Holder said his Deputy Attorney General, James M. Cole, was in charge of the AP investigation and would have ordered the subpoenas.[16] When questioning turned to the possibility of journalists being charged under the Espionage Act for reporting classified material, Holder stated: \"With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I've ever been involved in, heard of or would think would be a wise policy.\"[17]\n\nOn May 23, 2013, NBC confirmed with the Justice Department that Holder had personally signed off on the Rosen case. The Justice Department defended their decision and spoke about a balance between protecting national secrets and the 1st Amendment, stating: \"After extensive deliberations, and after following all applicable laws, regulations and policies, the Department sought an appropriately tailored search warrant under the Privacy Protection Act.\"[18] The revelation brought into question whether Holder was being intentionally misleading during his previous testimony when he denied knowing of, or being part of possible prosecutions of journalists. House Committee members sent an open letter to Holder, saying: \"It is imperative that the committee, the Congress, and the American people be provided a full and accurate account of your involvement.\"[19]"}

That you failed to follow the comment trail kind of says more about you than it does about me.\n\nSecond, as it stands, companies do not know if someone is at high risk for one issues or another until that medical malady actually happens. People can be at risk for diabetes because of family history, but make healthy life choices that means they never develop it. Someone could show no genetic issues in their family history, but be an unhygienic fat slob who will kill themselves early regardless.\n\nBut if this bill were to pass, the person making healthy life choices to stall, stop, or control potential genetic pitfalls will be treated the same as the fat slob. Joe and Dan could both be highly skilled and healthy programmers, but if Joe's family genetics show a high risk for an expensive disease while Dan comes out clean, Dan will get the job offers every time, and the best Joe can hope for is a pay cut to offset what the company deems an \"expensive risk\", or not be offered employer-paid insurance at all.\n\nGenetics is unchangeable, but that doesn't mean someone should be punished for it and fated to always earn less than someone who is not. Look at Stephen Hawking - one of the most brilliant minds on the planet but with an extremely genetically undesirable body. Yet because medically he was supported by a socialized health program - genetics be damned - he was able to continue living and continue contributing to the world. His children are treated no differently either. \n"}

It's to parse words in the context of actions.  Every legal analysis starts with words.  Sure, actions are invoked to assess the meaning/accuracy of words.  But ultimately judges are performing an act of textual interpretation.  It's exactly the fact that the law takes words seriously that gives it power. Even if an attorney makes a \"lawyerly\" evasion or justification, they're still required to justify an action in reference to a principle.  \n\nI only work in patent law rather than criminal law or tort law, but Trump's every statement drives me and my co-workers completely insane--because it's obvious trump doesn't take words seriously.\n\nTrump files obvious no merit lawsuits, and when called to defend himself tells straight up lies--not lawyerly evasions that are true \"from a certain point of view\". He'll make a statement in public and then-- instead of arguing the meaning of his words--will straight up deny he said them.  And when people hold him responsible for his words--he gets incensed because they're \"just words\" and he should actually be credited for the secret feelings in his heart.\n\nAnd all this would be fine if he were a private individual.  Sure, it'd make him an annoying asshole, but people have that right.  \n\nBut as president he's not just a person but the senior government executive.  He has immense power, which is only constrained by the fact that the presidency is an office defined and circumscribed by laws.  \n\nYou can say that's bullshit, but look at the enhanced interrogation debacle with Bush--his desire to have at least a  paper shield meant that he a) didn't argue (in publIc, anyway) that torture was ok, and b) constrained him to do it off of US shores.  \n\nNow imagine the same situation with trump.  Trump would say \"light em up! The terrorists deserve torture!\"--and then turn around and go to court to say \"it's not torture, I didn't say that\".  You think trump would limit torture to black sites? Because he doesn't proactively try to legally justify his actions, he's technically able to push boundaries way further than any normal person would.\n\nI'd argue that the judiciary's skeptical treatment of trump is entirely justified.\n\n/rant"}

Kind of like when you turn something in half baked and hope you get credit for the effort.\n\n* Neither McConnell nor Ryan really understand what they're up against, and they think that Republican Governors in purple states (and their Senators) will go along with them on this because of the two-year fig leaf.\n\n* Ryan thinks he can browbeat McConnell and Senate Republicans into trying their hand at improving this shit sandwich in hopes to barely get it through the Senate.\n\nMaybe there are other scenarios at play, but those are the first that come to mind for me. Of those, the first seems the most likely - the second and third seem preposterously out of touch, *even* for Republican Party leadership. \n\nEdit to add: I mean, there are two big, huge, gigantic fucking holes in this plan - how much it will cost, and how many people lose coverage. Someone's going to run the numbers and come up with estimates for both of those by the end of the week, and they're likely to be killers individually, much less together.

{"parent_id":"df422xt","created_utc":"1489893635","author":"georgiedawn","id":"df48hvv","body":"&gt; THere is almost NOTHING in the ACA that tries to control costs at all. THis is simply false. the ACA is almost entirely about expanding coverage. NONE of its major provisions does anything to reduce costs.\n\nThere is so much wrong with this statement I don't know where to begin. For one things, ACTUALLY READ THE LAW. You've been so focused on the first 8 pages that you've neglected the next 900, which is where the meat of healthcare savings are from. Also learn about healthcare economics; there are even great intro books to healthcare reform like Ezekiel Emanuel's book on the ACA, designed for a lay person like you.\n\nWhat you will learn if you actually interact with the healthcare system is that there is no one umbrella solution to fix healthcare because it is MANY THINGS that together cause high costs in the United States. Everything I mentioned in my description above tackles one of those many things by reducing the cost a little. EHRs are one of many ways in which we are trying to cut inefficiencies from the system. (side note: you need to get better sources. Your website is not a peer-reviewed healthcare policy journal like Health Affairs but rather an opinion piece from a partisan website). Last I heard, about 60% of healthcare costs in the US arises from inefficiencies that can be streamlined. The ACA helps make a thousand small tweaks in order to achieve the goals. I compare the changes to changing greenhouse emissions standards in cars. In the grand scheme of things, they will have little impact on climate change but they are an important stepping stone. Radical things like forcing everyone to give up meat won't be enactable. And in contrary to your 'tiny pilot programs,' Accountable Care Organizations have been quite a successful model that was adopted by providers of Blue Cross/Blue Shields Massachusetts and Kaiser Permanente. Read the article on the Alternative Quality Contract by Dana Safran in Health Affairs, which describes one version of this payment model.\n\nAlso, I don't know where you are getting your knowledge but getting insured does lower the overall cost, not just the average cost per person. How? The majority of high costs occur when a medical situation has gotten so bad that critical care has to be done on the patient. For example, if you had an infection and you put it off until you are hospitalized from septic shock, you have just costed the American healthcare system thousands of dollars when you could have gotten it looked at earlier and simply taken an antibiotic. Likewise if you are detected with cancer earlier, you will get treated with chemo, possibly surgery and have a decently good chance of survival (say 40-70%, depending on the cancer). But if you wait until you are in Stage 3 cancer, at that point, everything is incredibly expensive to treat. You are doing several surgeries to remove tumors, trying the newest fancy drugs in desperation, all in all very expensive. This is common among people who don't have health insurance. Why? Because it's expensive to see a specialist. Hence, not having insurance ends up placing a burdern on paying patients, since the cost is off-loaded to them. Hence, having health insurance enables people to get screened at low cost and treated before the situation gets worse. \n\nSide note: providing FREE healthcare has been linked with INCREASED costs; this is highly reproducible among many famous studies, including a recent on the journal Science. This is one reason why economists DO NOT recommend Americans become a single-payer system. The reason is people like using things when it is free. So if you had options, you would pick the newest and more expensive therapy rather than one that works, and you would also use things when you don't need to, leading to overuse of capacity. This is why economists recommend using a co-pay so people don't overuse things when they don't need to. This model is what France uses for their 'single-payer' system, and has been quite successful at keeping costs and usage lower."}

The North Korean economy is the size of a city in Ohio (Dayton I think Friedman said, if I recall correctly) so without Chinese aid the North Korea would suffer greatly. Now, China does not want a refugee crisis at its northern border should the North Korean regime totally collapse. If the North Korean leaders remain obstinate and bellicose--and obtain nuclear ICBMs-- the Chinese may feel enough pressure to exercise these economic levers in lieu of a direct strike from U.S. and allied forces.\n\nI suppose the deal, with Chinese support, is the best option since North Korea seems hellbent on gaining nuclear weapons capable of attacking the continental U.S. If not it is a question of whether world powers could accept a nuclear North Korea with its oppressive, temperamental, and malevolent history.

Other countries with higher VAT/sales taxes are funded on the backs of companies and individuals that buy and sell things in those countries.\n\nSo if you export from the US to a VAT country, you're taxed twice, and if you export from a VAT country to the US you avoid those taxes on both ends.\n\nThis is where Trump is bashing our trade deals, it's not that free trade is bad in principle, it's that we don't really have it when countries can mix taxing at production and consumption to create the same effect as trade barriers.\n\nMessing with currency valuation can have a similar effect, lower value currency makes exports easier and brings jobs to your country.\n\nNow, these policies do help some people in our economy. The steel mill might need to compete with Chinese steel but a real estate agent isn't worried you'll talk with someone from China instead when buying your next house. And some industries have stayed in the US because of talent that is not available all over the world (yet), like many software and medical companies.\n\nFor workers in these industries (often urban workers) a strong US dollar and the different tax structures help their buying power.\n\nThis basically means a transfer of wealth from rural America to urban America as our national policies on currency, taxation, and trade help one group to the detriment of the other."}

Google would be required to provide Edina police with basic contact information for people targeted by the warrant, as well as Social Security numbers, account and payment information, and IP and MAC addresses. StarTribune reports: Information on the warrant first emerged through a blog post by public records researcher Tony Webster. Edina police declined to comment Thursday on the warrant, saying it is part of an ongoing investigation. Detective David Lindman outlined the case in his application for the search warrant: In early January, two account holders with SPIRE Credit Union reported to police that $28,500 had been stolen from a line of credit associated with one of their accounts, according to court documents. Edina investigators learned that the suspect or suspects provided the credit union with the account holder's name, date of birth and Social Security number. In addition, the suspect faxed a forged U.S. passport with a photo of someone who looked like the account holder but wasn't. Investigators ran an image search of the account holder's name on Google and found the photo used on the forged passport. Other search engines did not turn up the photo. According to the warrant application, Lindman said he had reason to believe the suspect used Google to find a picture of the person they believed to be the account holder. Larson signed off on the search warrant on Feb. 1. According to court documents, Lindman served it about 20 minutes later."}

The CIA doesn't spy on americans because that would be redundant. Feds compartmentalized the actions of various spy agencies, likely two main reasons. One, cost savings- why have 3 spy agencies spying on overlapping people. Two, compartmentalize public anger. The CIA gets the public support it does, despite their Machiavellian reputation, because they target foreigners. If they need info on US citizens, I'd expect them to contact the agency tasked with spying on US citizens. Essentially it's a PR move after intel agencies reputations tanked in the mid 1900s.\n\nThat's my theory anyway."}

Is the fact that their party is \"divided\" going to make them stay home in close elections, or come out and vote in primary elections that are perceived to be a referendum on an establishment candidate?\n\nLet's use the Paul Ryan primary election as a proxy: Paul Ryan is generally considered to be about as establishment Republican as they come; he is generally hated by the more extreme elements of the Republican Party. Ryan was facing a \"tough\" primary against a populist challenger - Paul Nehlen - during a time when the Republican Party was seen to be \"divided\" (late 2016,) and absolutely destroyed his challenger regardless. Political inertia, along with a lot of money, goes a long way in quelling populist outrage in Primary elections.\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to assume the supposed divisions in the Democratic Party will play out much the same; a bunch of sound and thunder is coming from an extreme wing of the Party but in reality it will probably not translate to political change. \n\nAfter watching the 2016 Democratic Primary as a bemused outsider, it is clear to me that *the moneyed interests and power players in the Democratic Party are totally in control of the Party.* *They do not necessarily listen to, or care about, the concerns of the more radical left Wing.* With that in mind, I doubt that the turmoil within the Party - to the extent that it exists in the first place - will amount to much in the 2018 elections.\n\nI'm more interested to see if other Democrats will follow suit with Manchin in extending Donald Trump some decorum and working with the Administration to pass legislation. All it would take for Trump to pass some serious and far reaching reforms would be one or two Blue Dog Democrats worried about their election chances in 2018. \n\n"}

We no longer see Ford plants with 100,000 workers, but increasingly specialized firms with lean staffing, or businesses with far-flung satellite offices across the globe. This presents a challenge for organizing, as solidarity between workers is hard to foster across work-sites, let alone continents.\n\nFinally, the unions themselves bear some blame. Staid leadership and risk aversion has only exacerbated the trends working against organized labor, and there is an unwillingness to be bold among union bureaucrats. \n\nThat doesn't mean unions are a dying breed though.

The counter argument, as you have pointed out, is pretty predictable but when you build an argument from the ground up (lower income people do not have jobs where they can take time off without penalty and they often work odd hours... DMVs are often few and far between and are not open on weekends... Some states have narrowed the hours that DMVs are open... Per capita, minorities make up a larger portion of people in the lower income bracket) When you build the case properly, you leave fewer avenues to justify voter ID laws as they are written. When the first thing out of your mouth is that Voter ID laws are racist the opposition argues that the text of the law applies equally to everyone and then they invoke the fraudulent voter boogyman. It puts you on the defensive right out of the gate. I see this time and time again whether it's comments on a facebook article or an civil rights advocate brought onto a news show who has maybe 90 seconds to speak and a newscaster steering the conversation to fight with.\n\n&gt;There's no reasonable conversation to be had because they don't want one.\n\nI understand the sentiment but if you aren't willing to speak up and find an effective way to make you point the people overhearing the conversation inevitably are lost to the other side. The reason I specifically brought up voter ID laws is because at face value they seem like a good thing if you are a middle class American because you and everyone you know has an ID and from your perspective them seem easy enough to get. The argument against voter ID laws needs to be made in a clear manner so that people who are open minded and don't understand the problem with them aren't duped into believing that being against voter ID laws is a liberal conspiracy to rack up illegal votes."}

The only way health insurance works (or single-payer for that matter) is if healthy people support the sick people so that costs are averaged out. This was how they were planning to ensure that people with pre-existing medical conditions could buy in at a lower rate, while ensuring premiums wouldn't go up across the board. \n\nThe perspective as to why the ACA is 'failing' for conservatives is that premiums have been jumping up. The source of this is primarily that most young people found it is cheaper to pay the penalty than to buy health insurance. Heck, even on Reddits, there are many threads where people are talking about paying the penalty. This impact has caused either payers to pull out of Obamacare exchanges or force them to increase their premiums (in some states &gt;100%)."}

Nowadays in order to get elected you need donors, and people to vote for you.  it is pretty hard to be elected with just one of those factors.\n\n\nin theory because the official is no longer going to be incentivized by large donors, they would be forced to spend all of their energy on their constituents.  Officials would then be forced to not only show how they would vote on things, but why, and be able to articulate how they think about issues.  For the educated voter, you would have to implicitly trust them making decisions on your behalf.  Keep in mind all of this already happens, its just now you can verify if you are in agreement with their donors or not.\n\nyou may not be comfortable with trusting your elected official and hold them accountable, but isnt that the whole reason you have an elected official period?  Don't you think that is a problem with politicians that are in the current system, that they are not trustworthy to do the things they say they will do?  if you do not trust them to agree with you on important issues, why even bother with the system at all?\n\n\nthink of an example of this happening.  Say the senate is 50-50 split, and every member is publicly claiming to vote in a partisan manner.  If the vote ends up being not 50-50, the public would know someone lied (probably) within the losing parties caucus.  The internal fallout within the caucus would happen, and constituents from that party would be able to place blame on the whole party as opposed to any individual.  On the positive side of things, having them secretly vote would allow for the opposing party to more easily coax each other to form bipartisan alliances on issues/bills that they would otherwise not support out of fear of being primaried.\n\nonce again im not saying i completely agree with this sentiment, but I certainly think it is an interesting proposition"}

Liberals trusted that Obama's goal was to pass long-term comprehensive immigration reform that would result in a path to citizenship for many, and that he had no desire to make America whiter, or sow fear among immigrant communities, so liberals were willing to assume that if Obama's immigration policy was tough on immigrants, it was because he viewed that as the least that he had to do to maintain credibility.  By contrast, liberals don't believe that Trump shares Obama's baseline goals, and so view any expansions of anti-immigrant activity by the government with extreme suspicion."}

However, the raw vote count isn't the primary metric... just the most glaring one.  Regardless, it is happening much more in recent history than in historical times.  The situation is worse at the local level in the state legislatures.  To know if we hare headed in a bad direction is to look at the trend.  For instance, the popular vote not matching the electoral college is now happening more frequent than historically.  2 times in the first 200 years, now 2 times just in the last 20.  Obviously, not a trend we want to continue - for EITHER party.  [I want to be clear that I'm not arguing that Democrats are being treated unfairly or that Republicans have rigged the system (although the gerrymandering does lie at their feet given how we select districts).  I'm just saying that if you look at the numbers the trends of proper representation are not good.]\n\nSo, this isn't one party over the other.  This is simply the math of votes and voters being matched by their representation.  So, even in 2016 the vote split was 49.1 to 48 as Wikipedia says... but the house seat split 55.4% to 44.6%. So, it doesn't take a raw vote imbalance to produce a representation imbalance.  That 11% seat discrepancy vs 1% vote difference is the largest in our history... so again, the trend is not good.\n\n&gt; that the number of votes should determine the number of seats\n\nAgain, as shown above... the vote percentage should closely match the seat percentage.\n\nNow it's difficult to have the percentage match 100% perfectly every time [you can't split humans in half for instance - at least not and have them still be able to vote... ;-) ].  But it has been shown that with FPTP along with gerrymandering you will see discrepancies like we are having.  With STV and/or with better district makeup you will find that the seat count will only be off by minor rounding errors and most frequently by less than 1%."}

Malcolm X comes to mind. There are examples of other political movements that did have a prominent leader that were not effective as well.\n\nWhile I think your question is a fair one, I think the biggest factor for political movements being successful or effective is moreso a concrete objective. All of those examples of successful protests had concrete objectives: the right for African Americans to vote, to desegregate public schools, to remove the 'whites only' lunch counters and buses, etc. This point is somewhat arguable, but it wasn't clear to me what the exact objective or change movements like BLM or Occupy were going for. \n\nOne other interesting effect of when you have a concrete objective defined is that you try and work within the system first to achieve your objective.

But keep in mind that the idea of the president of the United States colluding with our adversary, in this manner, is almost incomprehensible. This is different than Nixon allegedly working with North Vietnam to sabotage Johnson's peace talks, or Reagan working with Iran to delay the release of hostages.\n\nThose are instances of Machiavellian, political quid pro quo. Unpleasant but not uncommon. Our current president *appears* to be a possible Manchurian candidate. Literally helping to implement the policy of a foreign government, apparently without regard for relative or absolute American gains. \n\nHow exactly? Let's look at one case, the INF treaty signed by Reagan and Gorbachev. This is the only nuclear treaty to eliminate an entire class of ballistic missiles (short- and intermediate-range). Putin began to delevop new short range missiles under G.W. Bush. Bush rebuked him and reported the matter to Congress. Obama did the same thing, and also held an emergency meeeting of the INF signatories in Geneva. \n\nPutin deployed short range ballistic missiles last month in Volgograd, close and about equidistant to Russia's conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine. It's also public knowledge that limited use of tactical nuclear weapons to quickly crush conflict in non-nuclear states is part of their current defense doctrine. And, of course, Trump has said nothing. I don't believe he's tacitly approving the use of battlefield nuclear weapons, but I keep in mind that the phrase \"useful idiot\" comes from Russia. \n\nI mention this case to point out that looked at in the right light, it does indeed appear that the president is under the influence of a foreign country. \n\nNow, to answer your question about whether the FBI and CIA would be on to this- as I said, this state of affairs is inconceivable. The Constitution concedes that a president might be guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, or might lose his mind, but to be an asset of a foreign adversary is not even in the rule book. If it were true, that a veritable mole got through the door of the highest office in the land, it would be hideously, permanently debilitating for American prestige and credibility.\n\nIn this instance, the intelligence community would take a long time indeed to figure out the best possible response. In the meantime they would likely know enough to be able to contain him."}

I try to draw the analogy, when the right creates crazy unconstitutional laws, and we lefties bitch and moan that they're wasting taxpayer dollars on a lengthy legal battle only to have it overturned. Well, say hello to many gun control laws. It's the same thing on the other side of the coin.

{"parent_id":"df9o61z","created_utc":"1490204525","author":"frommyredtintedtower","id":"df9q64s","body":"I agree, but I think there's a conceptual difference here. Most people with an economics background hear, \"Post-scarcity\" and think, well, there's always going to be a demand for something, so the idea of being beyond wanting something that not everyone can have is kinda silly.  Meanwhile, I think post-scarcity has gotten a connotation that means that we can provide for the basic needs of humanity.  \n\nAnd this difference creates schisms when talking policy.  Because people use the idea that we're beyond scarcity to start talking implementing programs, like, UBI and as a way to promote the idea of automation.  When in reality, scarcity still very much exists and that there is just a redistributive method towards property.  \n\nNow I can see some causes of UBI being a good way to promote a raise out of poverty and eliminate government functions that get mired in administration and over wrought processes.  However, the scope and scale temper my expectations and I think that protections need to be in place for misappropriation of funds and concerns with those suffering from addiction.  And as quickly as we got to UBI we start back down the winding path of our current entitlement system."}

Being better than Trump isn't the only thing they should be preaching. They need to present the American people with a vision of the country that's better than what the Republicans are putting forward. Certain factors like Republican's terrible healthcare plan will help make delivering that message a lot easier. I also doubt that it's really possible for Trump to deliver on any of his extremely lofty promises, which we'll bring a lot of moderates back towards a more reasonable party. You can even use \"Hope and Change\" as the core message of your campaign. \n\nOn another note, The combination of Perez and Ellison is encouraging to me, at least as a progressive.

You can spin the Google and see how bad they've worked out for yourself, but here are two examples: Louisiana, [where kids enrolled in private schools test scores plummeted](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-02-22/research-louisianas-school-voucher-program-harms-student-performance), and Wisconsin, [where almost *all* of the schools in their voucher programs are religious](https://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/28741-religion-permeates-wisconsin-voucher-system) to the point where some Catholic parishes receive more money from taxpayers than parishioners. The majority of WI students in voucher programs [were already enrolled in private, religious school](https://ffrf.org/outreach/item/18925-catholic-schools-win-big-in-wisconsin-voucher-scheme), so the idea that there is some \"choice\" being made by parents in failing public schools is ridiculous. \n\nI can see how Charter Schools can work, but they have to be non-profit (no pass-through to a management company) and well-regulated so they don't cherry pick students and leave more challenging learners behind. That's not the way it's been in MI, DeVoss' home state, and [their education progress shows it.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/betsy-devos-michigan-school-experiment-232399)\n\nI am also no fan of Obama's Race to the Top or NCLB/ESSA, the latter being unfunded mandates that have strapped public schools for cash. The general pattern, by Republicans and some Democrats, has been to starve public schools of funding then throw up their hands and yell \"the sky is falling\" and call for drastic solutions that eliminate public schools. The price of education doesn't exist in a vacuum - schools have facility, energy and technology costs that increase just like they do in the private sector, but somehow that gets left out of the arguments about \"greedy teachers' unions\". \n\nIf either party would take aim at consultants and standardized testing companies, that would be a breath of freaking fresh air. [Look at this bullshit from my state](http://www.nbcdfw.com/investigations/90-Million-Tab-for-STAAR-Testing-Includes-Pricey-Meetings-Travel-Consultants-201520411.html) - $90 *million dollars* spent in one year for STAAR test preparation as part of a $500,000,000 five year contract. After all that money was spent with Pearson, they turned over testing to ETS for $280,000,000 and they fucked up by losing entire schools' test scores so that year the STAAR just didn't count. My kid wasted a whole bunch of class time and TX wasted hundreds of millions of dollars that would have been better put to use in the classroom."}

It's very difficult to generalize across all states about their effect.  A small population state might not fare as well as the larger population ones.  Also, term limits undoubtedly cause some chaos when first implemented but the legislature will adapt in time.  Be careful that the studies you read don't capitalize on those issues to influence their conclusion.\n\nI don't think term limits should be dismissed so easily out of hand.   Term limits most obvious effect is on turnover and we currently have a major stagnation issue as Congress has a +95% incumbency re-election rate.  Given how term limit preform in large population states I find myself supporting them on the federal level.  Considering that the lobbyists don't seem to want them is all the more reason that I do."}
