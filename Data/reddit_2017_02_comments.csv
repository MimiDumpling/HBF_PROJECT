Nevermind that he expresses admiration for Darth Vader or Satan in that Hollywood Reporter article (maybe he's trolling the fuck out of us, would be his style). But, some of this other stuff? Trillion-dollar spending plan? The 1930s? That shit was not exciting. It sucked. For a lot of people. Decent, common, hard-working Americans, getting fucked by the excesses of the 1920s. Not exciting. And it was a build-up to one of the most disastrous periods of human history. Maybe us liberals will get another New Deal out of it at least, after everyone decides they've had enough human misery. I mean, if we have the money to pay for a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan and all, then another New Deal doesn't sound so expensive. Maybe he's just trolling us here too. In which case, fuck him anyway for trolling. This isn't some Hollywood cocktail party where you go around trolling liberals and then snickering about it later. It's policy, and people's lives.

The weird thing is though, how unsure I am whether the guy is trolling or just has a very misinformed version of history. Again, from that article - Thomas Cromwell?  I mean, the guy was eventually beheaded, much to the rejoice of court. Just a weird person to compare yourself to.

More Bannon hate coming from me, let's pick some points out of [this Buzzfeed article:](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/this-is-how-steve-bannon-sees-the-entire-world?utm_term=.bqK6wAq1x0#.hjqDP49xXW)

He likens WWII to
&gt; Judeo-Christian West versus atheists, right? 

This gem:
&gt; crony capitalism of people that are involved with these military powers-that-be in the government, and it forms a brutal form of capitalism that is really about creating wealth and creating value for a very small subset of people. 

Dude's a part of an administration of billionaires, peddling clothing lines, and promising to roll back many of the restraints that protect the People against them.

&gt; when capitalism was I believe at its highest flower and spreading its benefits to most of mankind

Colonialism? The slave-trade?

&gt;  I can see this on Wall Street today â€” I can see this with the securitization of everything is that, everything is looked at as a securitization opportunity. People are looked at as commodities. I donâ€™t believe that our forefathers had that same belief.

God bless our founding fathers for the nation they built for us, but, they also owned people. Literally. 

&gt;  there are people in New York that feel closer to people in London and in Berlin than they do to people in Kansas and in Colorado

Probably because they live similar lifestyles and perform similar functions within their societies. [This isn't really all that new either.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitanism). I'd imagine that rural folk from different countries feel the same way about each other.

Rick Perry and the DoE? The Trump presidency is really one big fuck-you to government. Is that what conservatism is? I mean, I guess the American Revolution was the ultimate fuck-you to the government, and we came out of that decently. You think Donald Trump, Steven Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway deserve to be in the same annals as George Washington? Maybe Andrew Jackson, which brings us to liberal outrage.

Andrew Jackson presided over the Trail of Tears. In fact, Donald Trump has a lot of striking parallels to Andrew Jackson - definitely not a soldier, but, at least, star of The Apprentice! It's hard not to be completely outraged at the idea of something similar happening again. Human misery and all. And yet, we've got an administration EXPLICITLY targeting legal residents because of their religious affiliation. I mean, talk about what the founding fathers would or wouldn't have wanted. I dunno man, the whole American mythos is built largely on the idea of Pilgrims, Puritans, etc escaping religious persecution. I mean, how can you not feel a bit of patriotism when people get out and peacefully protest the execution of un-American actions by the current administration. Fuck the government, right? I mean, when the current administration wittingly invokes the imagery of the 1930s? Persecuting a religious group? IT. IS. SCARY. And absolutely deserving of active protest.

&gt; In 1985 Sanders traveled to New York City to meet with [former Nicaraguan dictator Daniel] Ortega just weeks after Nicaragua imposed a â€œstate of emergencyâ€ù that resulted in mass arrests of regime critics and the shuttering of opposition newspapers and magazines. ... Sanders refused to condemn the decision. He was â€œnot an expert in Nicaraguaâ€ù and â€œnot a Nicaraguan,â€ù he said during a press conference. â€œAm I aware enough of all the details of what is going on in Nicaragua to say â€˜you have reacted too strongly?â€™ I donâ€™t knowâ€_â€ù But of course he did know, later saying that the Sandinistasâ€™ [Ortega's party] brutal crackdown â€œmakes sense to me.â€ù

&gt; [...]

&gt; To underscore his point, Sanders would usually indulge in counterfactual whataboutism: â€œIf we look at our own history, I would ask American citizens to go back to World War II. Does anyone seriously think that President Roosevelt or the United States government [would have] allowed the American Nazi Party the right to demonstrate, or to get on radio and to say this is the way you should go about killing American citizens?â€ù [...]

&gt; Or how about the Reagan counterfactual: â€œWhat would President Reagan do if buildings were being bombed? If hospitals were being bombed? If people in our own country were being killed? Do you think President Reagan would say, â€˜of course we want the people who are killing our children to get up on radio and explain to the citizens of the country how they are going to kill more of our people?â€™â€ù

&gt; Or perhaps Abraham Lincoln can convince you: â€œHow many of you remember what happened in the American Civil War and Abraham Lincolnâ€™s feeling about how you have to fight that war?

&gt; Lifetime ban on WH officials lobbying on behalf of foreign governments, five year ban on WH and Congressional officials lobbying after leaving their post (done)

Obama also dealt with lobbyist regulations in 2009, including a ban on lobbying in any capacity after working in public government. Trump's ban actually rolls this back, and says that you just can't lobby in the same area you worked in government. [Here's the source for that](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-lobbying-ban-weakens-obama-ethics-rules-234318). 

How effective do you think Trump's big ban will be? Someone working in government cannot lobby their department, but they can lobby the next department over and they will. This is actually a serious weakening of lobbyist regulations, dressed up as a tough ""ban"" to fool those who don't go beyond the headlines.

&gt; repeal the ACA (ongoing)

In what sense is this ongoing? 

Let's not get into hypotheticals here. How exactly is Trump leading the charge on this at all, beyond merely saying things about it?

Congress has not even begun to consider the details of their proposal. Here's a quote from Mark Sanford showing you where they are in the process:

&gt; As Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) put it: â€œThere seems to be a coalescing around principles; I donâ€™t think itâ€™s gotten deep in the weeds about what it will actually include yet.â€ù

They've barely even begun.

&gt; safeguard and expand gun rights (ongoing)

Again, what has he done? He's talked about revoking some EOs, but otherwise there's not much there. And what is there to be done anyway? How much more can you expand gun rights when you've got concealed carry in 42 states?

&gt; remove regulations regarding to small businesses (ongoing)

Again, how is this ongoing?

Are you referring to the ""repeal 2 regulations to create 1""? If so, that will do nothing for small business and is just a ruse. Access to loans and people willing and able to buy is what small businesses need, not some vague EO that can be interpreted however you like and provides nothing of substance for small businesses. It's another mirage.

&gt; pull out of the TPP (done)

This is one thing he did do. Sadly though, it will probably still happen but with China at the helm, which won't be good for the US. But a lot of people disliked the TPP for some reason (still not sure why), so you have a victory there.

&gt;  restore the balance of the Supreme Court 

What is this even supposed to mean? The court is 4-4 right now. How is making it 5-4 going to bring balance? 

&gt; approve the Keystone Pipeline (done)

He did remove the requirements for environmental studies to smooth the way for this. So I'd call that ongoing, if not done.

&gt; restrict immigration (ongoing)

This is ongoing, but can you say it's going well? It is a mess. If he wanted to do this right, he could have. But he issued a hasty EO and have to have another go at it. Ongoing, sure, but going well - I don't think so.

&gt; I'm far, far happier with this admin than I would have Hillary Clinton's

That's surely true, because Hillary would have been more of the same.

However, even though you're clearly pretty enthusiastic about Trump, I think you need to go a little deeper than the headlines. Your very positive list of Trump's accomplishments vanishes if you look at this stuff for more than a minute or so.

Obama didn't give them a whole lot of material due to his particular style and approach to the office. They couldn't usually take some clip of him saying something stupid and spin it, because he carried himself with a lot of dignity. His administration kept okay media discipline most of the time, so there weren't many cases where you had absurdities like Trump saying something directly opposed to what his spokesman said earlier that day.

But on many occasions they did try--for example, there was no small effort given to trying to make it seem like he was an empty suit married to a teleprompter. But that well got poisoned because Fox News took it and tried to run with it as a serious political critique.

Part of the problem was also that conservative media outlets were already trying to throw random shit at the wall to see what would stick. How's a comedy program going to keep up with it? As soon as Fox News turns it into the nightly news, it's no longer (intentional) satire and no longer fertile ground for comedians to poke fun at it. When the other side *immediately* latches on to any vague whiff of hypocrisy, you can't really make that into a segment on The Daily Show anymore.

&gt; They went easy on him and stuck to going after the out-of-power GOP.

Because the GOP practically hands them these bits on a silver platter. Going after the GOP was going after low hanging fruit. The Democrats never would have wandered into something as stupid as, say, making their first act of the new Congress a removal of the ethics office in Congress. The comedy practically writes itself with the GOP, because their cronyism and greed is pretty naked and hard to disguise.

People come out of these protests with connections, with literature and reading lists, new facebook friends, new ideas, and an expanded tactical vocabulary.

He also severely misses the mark with this ""exercise catharsis and emotional release"" idea. Sure, those elements are there, but this suggests that the emotions are gone afterwards. Quite the opposite, protests have the effect of firing up and mobilizing the participants, even on an individual level without the networking effect mentioned above. Participating in a protest is extremely energizing. Sure you get your rage or sorrow out as well, but the wells those emotions flow from are in turn filled with camaraderie and optimism that you take back home with you.

Even with the so-called ""fringe"" he complains about, he misses the point of their actions, which is to draw out state repression and expose the threat of violence quietly backing all the barricades and ""free speech zones"" which serve to curate and limit protest so as to be ineffective and non-disruptive as possible.

In April the insurance companies must commit to be in the marketplace for 2018.

This is what happened in Washington state, the market collapsed and they had to [roll back the rules](http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/21/nation/la-na-health-insurance21-2010feb21) back in the 1990's.

Without the mandate either people will only buy insurance when they need it, like women who buy it when they become pregnant, or people will be shut out of the system if they lose their policy or jobs,  and they will end up with no coverage.

Remember the mandate is a GOP idea, it's also known as personal responsibility. The high deductibles are also a GOP idea that's known as skin in the game and they use it to keep medical spending down.

While there have always been protests (anyone remember GWB years?), the integration of social media has made it easier to rally together on the basis of 'fake news' or any narrative which can be driven via clicks/likes/karma jerks.  Because many do not know how to interpret this new form of media other than how it is presented, it can quickly lead to herd mentality which can lead to echo chambers and social/political divides.  The breaking point, of course, is when violent individuals meet other violent individuals within these divides.

It probably also doesn't help that the main news networks treat social media as if they represent all of society and thus, gives them a larger role in shaping the overall narrative.  This only makes it easier for protestors to rally when you have ""fake news"" or popular internet 'narratives/counter-narratives' being treated on the same playing field as professionally written and researched news.

Essentially, the ""mainstream media"" misinterprets media themselves, of which makes it easier for others to do so.  

Of course, that's not to say 'news' doesn't happen unless they are reported by an official source.  Obviously not.  Rather, it's to say that if you carelessly drive a narrative (especially ones where the sky is falling if 'xyz' conditions are met), people will react without critical thought.

This is not even fucking close to true. The alt-right are white nationalists and neo-Nazis. Many of them advocate genocide or forced relocation of minorities, as well as their systematic oppression and abuse. Their ideology is driven by pure hatred.

Anti-fascists are individuals whose only hatred is for fascists. They seek to prevent fascists from imposing their agenda by confronting fascism head-on, with violence where necessary. Anti-fascists believe in equality and the liberation of minority groups, freedom from oppression and ending the spread of fascist ideologies.

They are polar fucking opposites. They both use violent means, but the latter uses those means as a response to the former. Neither group has the goal of 'chaos'. The alt-right seeks to destroy anyone who doesn't fit into their vision of how the world should be - today's anti-fascists only seek to destroy the alt-right.

There are a number of twists and turns to civil forfeiture law, and it certainly is not as simple as the subject at hand.  District Court splits are due to the differences in laws of states in the district.  There really are no differences in bathroom laws.

&gt;3rd, 5th, and 9th splits on strip searches on minors without a warrant  

In Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington SCOTUS held that the practice of conducting strip searches on all inmates, regardless of an individualized suspicion or the severity of the underlying offense, does not constitute an unreasonable search and does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Since the superior court ruled, there can't be a split.


&gt;5th and 11th splits on 4th amendment rights for prisoners  

Again, rights under state laws.  The Federal District court is reacting to particular laws.

Though I'm not from NC, and I assume you aren't, so we can't speak to what they were thinking.  

Truly though, the bathroom issue has been botched from the beginning.  I can't believe liberals aren't taking the stance that everyone should have the right to choose who sees them naked.  It's so obvious.  If a homophobic teen doesn't want gay guys to see him change in the locker room, he should have access to a private changing room.  It doesn't matter if he's homophobic, it's his body.  

The problem is that to implement that would cost like trillions of dollars.  But why are progressives so intent on maintaining the bathroom status quo, and just shoving gay and trans people in the middle, instead of reacting to the changing landscape?  Why are progressives arguing that it's homophobic to think a gay teen could be aroused in a locker room full of naked teens of the same gender?  That's the definition of gay teen.  

Liberals probably have the practical side on trans bathrooms.  But they don't have the liberal side.  They're progressive, not liberal, because being liberal would require true progressivism.

if you look at Trump's CPAC speech , here on [Time](http://time.com/4682023/cpac-donald-trump-speech-transcript/) he talks at length about the press 

After the media looking to a lot of people especially Trump like an arm  of the Democratic party rather than they fourth estate of  yore , well basically Trump  wants sources out in public, a more honest and balanced reporting style and more news, less agendas 

He doesn't mind criticism per say of course and doesn't favor censorship either only consequences , ""fake news"" access shut off, put up or shut up  

And yes though Trump is a public figure he has no more obligation to support someone he perceives to be against him and his values than Reddit does . 

Neither he nor Reddit can arrest people (well theoretically Trump can but there is no evidence of any such plans) but they both can ban them and its what Trump does

Play nice, fair criticism allowed or no access 

What makes this different is previous Presidents were mostly politicians and none of them were used to or understood  the media in the way Trump does . 

Generally back in the day , the Press was treated with deference by the executive  , thought important and powerful 

Trump having survived a ferocious onslaught by them decided they weren't that important in the Internet age and were a problem and so we get what we have now. 

Long term, it doesn't mean much , less press access for Liberals for now, Conservatives when the Liberals when oh well. 

In the end the President has the Internet and so do we and can use its tools to make up our own minds without  the media  trying to tell us how to think . This  is a very good thing and the exact way out of authoritarian politics or fascism

&gt; You mean you're emotionally hurt because people in red states will be hurt? If you don't live there, how are you hurt exactly?

I asked a question, which you didn't answer. You instead changed the context from an honest question directed at OP to an argument.

So I think it's fair to say the terms of the conversation have changed. But lets go with your argument then.

What is the standard you're claiming? How do you apply your standard to states like Saudi Arabia and other countries where women are treated like slaves? Is it proper for us to use force in order to ""liberate"" those people from those conditions as well?

Also, what situation is analogous to slavery today? Slavery is already gone, so why is that relevant? I responded by saying that abortion is actually the closest parallel to slavery today : Fetuses don't get a say in whether they're aborted or whether they wanted to come into the world, and they're under the total control (life or death) of their parents. If you aren't referring to abortion, what issue do you think parallels slavery today in terms of the moral imperative to intervene?

You realize that if I say ""live and let live, and think local"", these problems are resolvable. Worry about your own backyard and your own state, then worry about other states. Is that evil for some reason? Like, if I don't care about solving starving children in Africa just this second because we have bigger problems here, or I don't care if Texans can own machine guns because California has problems of it's own, is that evil?

Btw, going back to slavery - Alabama wanted to force New York to return escaped slaves, and to enforce slavery laws while slave masters were traveling in the north, and **the south** decided to seceede - Abraham Lincoln was **willing to compromise** with the south, the Confederacy left. So even your example is bad, New York never forced the south to do anything, until war was declared.

Quite possibly. A lot of corner stores are getting more grocery storeish as a consequence. Prices are still high though.

Yes, increasingly people living in food deserts are having to turn to fast food restaurants in the area to eat. Especially the very low cost ones. This is likely to have a long-term knock-on effect since it means they're not passing on cooking skills (or the cooking inclination) to their children.

Could not agree more; if the Dems don't pick up at least 15 seats in the House and maintain or gain in the Senate and in governorships across the country, it will all but end whatever momentum they think they have. This is equally on the voters and on the representatives themselves -- they need to put forward candidates that can speak to their base and can win any mildly-contested races, just like the Tea Party did, but they need to learn from the Tea Party's mistakes and not put forward batshit insane candidates like ""I'm Not A Witch"" and ""2nd Amendment Remedies"" and ""Greenhouse Gasses Make Trees Grow"".

No, I left the conclusion as implicit. Explicitly: the fact that you can't (really) leave the State means that under the circumstances where you don't want to live under a state, means that the state cannot possibly be justified for those individuals.

&gt;Then those people can leave

And go where? Almost all land is occupied by a state. Almost all land that's not is inhospitable. So sure, they *can* leave, but they *feasibly* can't.

Yes, it's immoral for anarchists to refuse to pay taxes simply because they're anarchists. But it's also wrong for a state to force them to live under them. Under the current state of affairs someone is always being immoral. The solution is to allow anarchists to live in hospitable land that does not receive any benefits from the state, nor does the state have any power in that area. 

As for your capitalism comment: You said that you can not want to live under capitalism but capitalism can still be voluntary. I don't exactly see how not consenting to a system can still make the system voluntary *for everyone living under it*.

That's not entirely true. Much of my family (Protestants) sort of see pregnancy as you describe, but I (Catholic) have come to see pregnancy as something much more awe-inspiring, beautiful, and a blessing.

I'll grant that many fellow Catholics would agree with you there, but from what I've studied, Catholic theology is much more nuanced on sexual issues than merely seeing sex as purely utilitarian. It's a bit wordy, but St. Pope John Paul II's *Theology of the Body* excellently describes sex as both good due to procreation as well as the emotional bond it creates between the married couple:

&gt;The marriage actâ€_â€™ at the same time â€˜unites husband and wife in the closest intimacyâ€™ and together makes them capable of generating new life.â€™ Both the one and the other happen â€˜through the fundamental structure.â€™ Since this is so, then it follows that the human person (with the necessity proper to reason, logical necessity) must read at the same time the â€˜twofold significance of the marriage actâ€™ and also the â€˜inseparable connection between the unitive significance and the procreative significance of the marriage act. Here we are dealing with nothing other than reading the language of the body in truth.

So essentially, the focus between the two groups are seperated based on how sex as an act is viewed in the first place; Catholicism teaches how awesome and beautiful it is (aka it's good) while many other Christians (some Catholics included) just see sex as you say and practically demonize it."5t4l69,1486692589,AutoModerator,ddk33hk,"[A reminder for everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4479er/rules_explanations_and_reminders/).

The religious right have had the privilege of a relatively stable economy to vote on social issues first. If there's another economic crisis under the GOP's watch and the economy goes under because they're unable to pass a stimulus package or bailout (which will definitely happen, the Cruz led Tea-tard brigade will refuse any bailout or stimulus package that's not 100% military spending) then religious conservatives will vote to put their economic interests first in such a situation.

Hell in an economic crisis under the GOP voter turnout for Dems would soar from both their base and swing voters and new voters would turn out strongly even for a Socialist Sanders candidate. Also a good amount of high earners would vote Democrat as a backlash to the Tea Partiers leading us into the Great Depression Part 2."ddq1de3,1487055010,[deleted],ddq1fyp,[removed]ddr1r9s,1487147737,Chernograd,ddro32c,Years ago he left the Reform Party because of David Duke?

Literally the only thing the New Yorker had to check was that Schwartz did in fact ghostwrite Trump's book. All of the rest can be fabricated by Schwartz whether it's good or bad opinion on Trump.

Sander's message was never about idpol, it was about economic equality and it captured what was suppose to be the demography most friendly to LGBT/gender issues (millennials). I suspect people who care about the social issues are never gonna vote R anyway and economic messaging has wider appeal among swing demographics.

&gt;What they do not tend to agree with is the anti-white (or maybe better described as white guilt since it seems to be mostly white people espousing this) ""you're racist and you don't even know it and you can't even do anything about it because your skin color makes you a racist in a racist system""

The race thing is a lot more dubious because though I agree segments of the left has gone to far as to make all white males the enemy (guess who voted trump in cuz of that lol) and frankly has horrible attitude towards rural whites many of whom are also effectively members of marginalized communities in the US at this point.

The other X thousand pages explain how it works across a multi-billion dollar industry which has millions of people working in it."""5tzyl0,1487176110,georgiedawn,dds2kvc,"Political parties are not inherently good or bad. They just do what is essential for them to survive, and for this we need to talk about power. Everything I'm writing now is universal, like evolution. All mammals essentially practice the behaviors.

If you ever live in a society with more than one person, you need power. Power is what gives your decisions higher priority than another person. In order to enact policies that you think are important (ie. climate change legislation), you need to be in power.

However, no one inherently has power. All people who wants to have power always needs supporters, because power is contractual. The President has power becasue we gave him power based on his promises during the campaign. In non-democracies, a ruler has power because people tacitly consents to him to being in power; if he violates that contract, the peopel will rise up and get rid of him (ex. Tsar Nicholas II). Same thing in animal kingdom: the strongest often has more power because he can provide others with more food/defend the tribe. When he gets sick, a younger animal will seize power. So you need to have supporters that grant you power. In a society, technically everyone that can vote is a supporter in name; lets call them the nominal selectorate.

The thing is not everyone has an equal voice. Some people are worth more than other people: having the support of Ted Turner is incredibly powerful because he can make CNN blast out anti-Trump messaging, which is far more influential than having the support of your average Joe Schmo. Likewise, having the support of a billionaire means you will have access to unlimited superPAC funds. Thus, from a numbers game, it is not only more efficient, it also makes more sense to reach out to those people. This is why Clinton or Obama fundraises with wealthy donors; because their support is more important than the average citizens. This is also why during the campaign, they did their best to influence the electoral college, because they are the ones who actually cast the vote. They didn't need to influence the entire college - Trump never reached out to Democrat senators; you only need the number that is essential to win power; let's call them the winning coalition.

The problem is those people who are influential are also in their own positions of power. They also require the support of those under them (such as the Board of Directors if it's a CEO). And likewise the Board of Directors needs the support of other people so they remain on the Board. So power is an endless chain of who supports who.

The big question is why would someone support you over another contender. It's because they give something back that would help THEM remain in power. So to be in power, you have to hand out to your supporters things that will benefit them. A politician will enact policies favorable to his voter base - Democrats support Afro-American causes to get Black people's support, Trump supported the wall to get support. But more importantly, they will also do projects that are critical to the influential base. Palin supported the Bridge to Nowhere because it got her support from Ketchikan, an critically important district for her Governship bid. It doesn't matter if policies are smart; only that it is essential for political survival. Even people like you do this all the time; you support your friends so that they like you (after all you are friends) and that gives you influence among that group.

So back to political parties, they aren't inherently good or bad. By natural selection, they have to be more oriented towards the survival of the party or else they lost influence. That's why the Democrats/Republicans are in positions of power whereas the Green Party never gets into power. The former cares about their own survival. In order to do that, they need to address the interests of their voter group, specifically the winning coalition. Sometimes that overlaps with society, yet sometimes it doesn't.

If you're more curious about this btw, in poltical science, this is called selectorate theory. It's incredibly robust and well respected by political scientists. These practices are what happens in the real world situations among businessmen and politcians; you can see it everyday but hopefully it now makes sense. 

This also explains much of the 'crazy' things the Trump administration has been doing. Trump doesn't necessarily believe the crazy acts he does but he needs the support of Bannon because he rules Brietbart, a media outlet. He also does things that support McConnell, Ryan and Fox News to get conservative voters. Ironically, what would help Trump not be crazy is if people had taken him seriously during the primaries; due to his inability to get mainstream Republicans to support him, he had to switch his source of power to the more radical wings. But the attacks by the MSM will now further force him to isolate himself as the only people supporting him will be the more extreme Trump suporters."de5dvse,1487951235,soitcause,de5rqoz,"What have you seen significant numbers of people do that you consider ""radical leftism""?

Why?dec11fm,1488310388,Gruzman,dec1gj1,"&gt;Is accepting me as a woman really that big of an imposition?

Depending on the circumstance, sure. I don't want to be forced by law into accepting a totally arbitrary standard of gender, because I think that making the distinction totally arbitrary would create as many problems as it would solve. Potentially far more than it would solve considering that the amount of people who are set on becoming the other gender is very minuscule compared to the large portion of society that essentially sets the ""standard"" for gender by existing on their own, without any kind of extant 'choice' made to do so. People like me. I support freedom of expression and gender expression falls into that somewhat, but I don't support a singular authoritarian categorization of how gender works enacted with the experience of an ultra-minority in mind to work as law over the experience of the ultra-majority. 

Among other things it leads to violent disagreement with people who just want to ask questions about the ideology that supports and buffets the concept of being transgender. If that ideology is internally inconsistent, which discussions with transgender people lead me to be believe, *and* externally inconsistent, meaning that no one can come to a complete consensus on the subject of being transgender, then there's all kinds of problems for everyone. That's what we're currently experiencing in society, now. 

&gt; Can't you see how social non-acceptance has a far greater and far more negative effect on the lives of trans people than our asking you for tolerance has on yours?

I can, but I can also wonder aloud why someone who is totally convinced of their being better suited to the other biological gender in their mind is not also prepared to deal with the fact that what they're saying might not mesh at all with how other people conceive of gender. What makes your ideology better suited to the facts: social, biological, or otherwise, than anyone else's? So much of what I see in transgender discourse is a reliance on describing how the norms of gender work for everyone, so that they can explain their exact relationship to them: but if people can't even agree that those norms necessarily exist in the way you explain, then we all have a problem.

Soooo how do we reduce actual racism?

I don't know if there's any research to back this up, but I'm pretty sure people are less likely to be bigoted against a group if they have friends who are part of that group; it makes it harder to see caricature/stereotype them and see them as the ""other"".

I can understand a reasonable basis for this belief, although I think good faith and adherence to precedents of political behavior form very substantial checks on government action.  Trump's rejection of those norms are likely to have lasting effects (best case) and may actually lead him to fundamentally re-order the state to grant himself more power (worst case).  I also personally think the erosion of those norms are far more destructive to liberty than, e.g., a 3% increase in top marginal tax rates, but I suppose we'd have to agree to disagree there.

But in retrospect, he was probably too similar to Clinton, and she would've benefited from someone who helped with her weaknesses. Al Franken maybe could've been a better choice from this perspective -- while he has shown himself to be a competent, hard-working senator with his constituents in mind, he has a strong and interesting personality from a background of being a comedian, which is about as anti-establishment as one could imagine.

Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly and explicitly rejected the notion that the political branches have unreviewable authority over immigration or are not subject to the Constitution when policymaking in that context. See Zadvydas v.

I also think that there is little recognition for middle America's loss of income due to certain military budget cuts and environmental regulations. Without seeking to close the gap, Democrats lost Progressives and middle America this last election.

The Democrats need to play to their strengths. There needs to be a separation of church and state. Our constitutional rights beed to be respected. The middle class shouldn't be saddled with all of the tax burden, because billionaires can handle paying taxes too. 

Democrats need to stand up for the hybrid of capitalism and socialism in the American economy. We don't do the extreme version of capitalism or socialism because it isn't the American way. We provide social services in order to level the playing field of opportunity. We socialize things like education or prisons so that those institutions aren't corrupted to serve a few who are rich and powerful. 

Americans see a problem with institutions like governments and businesses becoming too large and ruling the rest of us against our will. Democrats need to start working in local government to drive change too. Can't do it all from an ivory tower. In fact, we don't want to.

The litmus test for being a Democrat should only be that people want and seek progress. It shouldn't be a question of whether someone remembers the proper acronym or identity label that someone prefers. Democrats need to start realizing that we need a more inclusive government. We need youth, women, people of color, LGBT, and other people disproportionately affected by historic and current US policy/culture. We need people inside the power group to be allies for those who are not empowered.

1. If they look white they'll be considered White. This is basically if they have a more light brown skin tone, and like in your case, if they could pass as an Italian/Mediterranean white person then they'll be considered white.

2. Half Asian/half white almost always have English derived surnames since the father is usually white. The Hispanic/white kids I know usually have a white father so the surname shows through as well. I did have one friend growing up with the last name Orozco (with an English first name) who had light skin and looked and considered himself to be white.

"debue7m,1488305099,Gruzman,debwdi2,"&gt;Our scientific understanding of human behavior can often answer these questions for us.

What scientific sources are you citing, here?

&gt;For instance, we know that forcing individuals to confirm to societal standards of beauty by binding their feet or cracking their ribs with too-tight corsets is unhealthy

It's considered beautiful and useful in the eyes of the society in which it is done, though. Thus the trade-off is seen as worthwhile by some. We view the costs as outweighing the benefits and we additionally suppose that people should be free first to *choose* whether they adopt a harmful practice to their person. That's not an instance of an objective standard, just a (agreeable) principle that we have of avoiding unnecessary harm. That principle is useful in a slew of other applications so we adhere to it more universally and to the detriment of other cultural adaptions made by other societies. 

&gt;so as a society we instead try to encourage acceptance of a broader range of healthy body figures.

Who is ""we as a society?"" I personally don't believe that there is really a broad definition of a ""healthy"" body figure. Most bodies are objectively unhealthy to varying degrees, and only athletes are ever in the best possible shape for a human body. Even professional athletes are variously unsuited to physical activity that they don't practice for. Therefore encouraging people to simply expand what they label ""healthy"" behavior and body shape is merely a psychological exercise in short term self-satisfaction. It's akin to telling people who smoke cigarettes that everyone loses their breath sometimes, and that people simply have a limited scope of lung capacity acceptance, so it's ok to keep smoking. This seems to be rooted in a principle of total Permissiveness, which isn't necessarily a principle who's expansion to universality nets objective improvement in the whole of society. 


&gt;It's not just that one opinion is better than the other - We know to the best of our current understanding that one path leads to better life outcomes than the other.

I don't think we necessarily ""know"" one way of doing things is better than another. We certainly *believe* that one way can be better, but we often also lack the real perspective on the facts of the matter to *know* it for certain. This is why so many cultural distinctions exist between human societies, even today. Norms are not all equally good and useful, nor equally as rational: but to a large extent they are arbitrary to one another and arise out of unique historical circumstances in a given geography. They can be changed back and forth, preserved or destroyed. The point being that there is no obvious lineage of ""progress"" that can be studied in how the whole of humanity lives. Merely the disconnected lineages of different organizing principles which vary in their usefulness and reproducibility from generation to generation.

We're paying far more than countries with universal health care even while we don't get universal health care. I don't think deregulating back to the Bush-era is going to help. Health insurance unfortunately doesn't exactly follow typical free market practices and insurance premiums were rising back then, too. Can we afford not to fix our health care? The taxes our government currently spends on health care is literally greater than the amount it would cost to cover everyone 100% if we had another country's plan. 

Same with college. The first step to collecting taxes is having taxable incomes in the first place. A high-school education job these days often does not pay very well, and it's not going to get any better. Skipping college can significantly lower the amount of income someone brings in for their entire lives, and really slashes the amount of taxes they pay. Long term food stamp recipients are likely to not have a college degree, and unemployment numbers are ridiculously high for those without college degrees. Without college (or trade school) I would argue we're training a workforce for the 20th century, and that leaves us noncompetitive globally.

What's going to happen when we have even more automation down the line and people don't have the skills to get new jobs? Our society won't be the same when we have small amounts of people  bringing in millions each year and others making just $30k. I am honestly fearful of how many more people are going to be on food stamps in the coming decades once their job gets automated. Those future costs can be mitigated by sending them to college now, and their children may also become more likely to go to college since their parents went.

One day we may not import as many skilled immigrants as we do, and we're going to start to rely on natural born innovation even more. Elon Musk could have immigrated to China instead of the United States, and then they would have Tesla and SpaceX.

You can't really opt-out of that in the same way since you benefit from living in a lawful environment even if you don't personally interact with the law enforcement system.

But it's easy to see how in principle the government could be dramatically reduced in size â€“ social security and healthcare are more than half the federal budget and those benefits are administered on an individual basis, so it's not hard to imagine a system where you can opt out.

If they trigger Article 5 and we don't respond with overwhelming deployments of US assets to defend Latvia, then we have already lost and Russia will have free reign to topple most Eastern European nations by force and cow the rest into submission if they don't have the guarantee provided by NATO. 

It's crazier to allow it to happen. Appeasement like this only delays war, it does not prevent it. Russia will strengthen itself through expansion and then they will come for something we will *not* be willing to part with, except this time they have much more access to military assets and resources.

It's more likely Russia backs off and retreats to within their own borders (or near to it) if we start massive NATO deployments. Russia would lose such an invasion, badly, and Putin understands a loss of this magnitude would severely hurt his standing at home. He would more likely back away from such a maneuver before fully engaging a NATO army. He would only consider it if he didn't think NATO would respond to an invasion of Latvia, which would destroy the NATO alliance entirely and create an incredibly dangerous powder keg in Eastern Europe.

I hope you mean that you just found all the demands to be disorganized, not that you actually don't know what the issues they were protesting were. Because the issues were abundantly clear, there were just a lot of them.
&gt; 

Thats precisely the same problem Hillary Clinton had during her campaign. She ran on a seemingly endless number of issues, however by trying to do everything she ended up not having a clear message.

Demanding that neutral/uninvolved parties read up on it in order to educate themselves is an exercise in futility. If your movement requires that people do the work and learn about it for themselves your movement has already failed.

Marketing is all about delivering a succinct, strong message. Focus on small number of things with laser like precision. Get that message across. People will remember that message.

My experience with left learning protests is that they throw everything, including the kitchen sink, into the protest. By trying to protest everything they end up protesting nothing. This isn't new. I remember the Iraq war protests everyone brought their own personal pet cause to the march. To this day I still don't understand what Palestinians had to do with the Iraq war and yet the march was full of these posters for some incomprehensible reason. The protests of course failed. War began and Saddam Hussein was toppled.

Right leaning protests, such as the Tea Party, had that laser like focus on a small number of demands. Not only that, but they had a plan to get their demands. Tea Partiers organized, ran for office, and won a remarkably large number of Congressional seats. The Tea Party was able to hijack the GOP, leading to some tense situations with the budget and government shutdowns."dd8p2od,1486054985,wh40k_Junkie,dd8ppa2,"Historically, the side that resorts to violence has the weaker arguments and have to rely on violence since their arguments don't stand their ground

Hillary lost Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan narrowly largely for two reason.

The other reason is because the traditional urban and suburban constituencies didn't turn out as they had for Obama, especially in Detroit proper. Minnesota was the only tossup Midwestern state that went for Hillary and did so narrowly. My point is, can it be shown that Ellison actually had an effect on turnout, therefore keeping Minnesota blue? St. Paul-Minneapolis went for Hillary by a similar margin that it went for Obama both times but so did a city Milwaukee, Wisconsin where Hillary lost.

The ""in touch with the base line"" is also funny to me since Bernie lost the nomination in the first place whereas Obama won two terms (and the states in the Rust Belt Hillary lost as well as Florida) and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote up running a lackluster campaign against two candidates vaguely tied to a foreign power and a hostile FBI.

I don't often find reasonable sounding conservatives on the internet and I really want to understand core principles and beliefs of the people with whom I disagree. (I was once full on hard libertarian myself, but I've lost touch with that thought process because my friends and acquaintances either all went the same way I did or are just gun happy idiots.)

**Drugs:** hard to argue with this one. Legalize, regulate, tax. With the right infrastructure (licensed shops/better funded emergency services/etc.) even harder drugs could be okay. 

**Guns:** on one hand, we're probably never going to agree on the necessity of allowing firearms to be owned privately, nor am I going to be able to understand why you'd want or need an automatic rifle to begin with. I think we will just have fundamentally different interpretations of the 2nd amendment. That said, I think it's important that the cost/difficulty of entry into the ownership of automatic weapons is inhibitively high, for general public safety reasons. If you, in the interest of public safety, to bring the cost down but the difficulty up to compensate, how would you like to do that and how would you fund that infrastructure? Alternatively, if you would just prefer to lower the bar and increase the availability and therefore sheer numbers of automatic weapons, why?

**Tobacco:** at this point I don't think the warning labels are ever going away since taking them off packages would result in very winnable lawsuits by tobacco induced cancer patients claiming they didn't have enough warning to know they'd get cancer. As for restaurants, I agree that standalone bars and restaurants should have the discretion to allow or disallow smoking. However, I don't think smoking in restaurants will ever make a comeback if the chef/owner has any aspirations of upward and outward growth. Bars are whatever in my mind; nobody goes out drinking to be healthy. 

**Drinking age:** 100% agree. An adult is an adult and should have the full rights of an adult, whatever that age may be. Drinking, smoking, serving in the military, whatever, 18 is adult enough IMO. (Maybe driving also, but that's my personal opinion.)

**Free trade:** this is the one I want most to discuss. In my view, taking into consideration advances in medicine, robotics, and other technologies, we need to change how we look at the system of humanity. Until now, using the Industrial Age mindset focused solely on growth was great and no doubt got us to where we are today. However, I feel that particularly with the coming wave of automation that the human system, ever growing technology and invention, has reached a kind of saturation point where we achieved the ultimate goal of technology in the first place: to make human life easier with minimal work so that more time can be spent focusing on art, music, and recreation. 

Nonstop focus on growth for the sake of growth will do nothing but drain the worlds resources to nothing while perpetuating human suffering. In this day and age I believe it is time to start focusing on the human part of the system, stop worrying about growth and instead on sustainability and happiness. And it's not like technological progress will just stop either; rather, refocusing on intellectual and technological growth in the world will take us to the stars, to the end of hunger and war. It ~~sounds~~ is naive and utopian but the only reason we all struggle so hard is that a few wealthy bureaucrats feel the need to compete with each other and keep everyone else down, and have thoroughly convinced the world that this is the way things must be. 

Therefore, the arguably negligible systemic growth that can be achieved by gifting huge amounts of power to corporations through laws like NAFTA and the TPP is not worth supporting, and I'd like to know why you think it is. 

**Intervention:** with the economy becoming ever more globalized, I think it is time for the world's governments to get with the times. The UN needs more support from the world, more funding, and more autonomy. The concepts of nationalism and countries in general are outdated in my opinion. For bureaucratic purposes - governing, funding, elections, and the like - divisions are necessary for humanity to function properly but again, I will never be able to have any enthusiasm or fight on behalf of the greed of rich bureaucrats and fat cats. 

With proper funding and international support, the UN could deal with civil wars and various human atrocities swiftly and diplomatically.

&gt; Bernie beat Hillary on head for her vote on Iraq war. She was a senator of NY at that time. Would Bernie have voted against it if he was a senator of NY? 

Good point. I assume he only could succeed at his schtick in Vermont. I don't think he would have voted for the Iraq war, though, even as a senator in NY. If anything, he would either have not been elected in the first place or would soon be ousted from office following his inevitable vote against the war. My point is that that integrity is what makes him appealing to voters in the first place, which is why I think he functions best as an Independent. It allows him to speak his mind and appear not beholden to special interests/party lines (a big theme this election cycle).

I also didn't claim that he is unwilling to compromise. He did endorse Clinton after all, even to the chagrin of his more extreme supporters. [He also passed more roll call amendments under Republican control than any other senator for about eight years.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/24/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-was-roll-call-amendment-king-1995-2/) To me, that isn't indicative of someone who isn't willing to compromise. Unlike the Republican ""Party of 'No'"", Sanders actually has a vision for what he wants to accomplish. That's an important distinction, to me.

I agree that he likely couldn't achieve 90% of what he espouses (especially after the conservative meltdown over the ACA), but that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive for them. As a corollary, I think that also means we should speak openly about our goals, even if they are not politically feasible at the moment.

The reason for the amendment was because of corruption among Senators, what we should have done was simply amend the Constitution to set strict rules for that."dd6v9tr,1485990065,ArmchairHacker,dd7lq76,"You really can't discuss Planet Breitbart without discussing the Mercers. The Mercers are actually one of the investors in the *Breitbart* news website, if I recall correctly. The Mercers also founded Cambridge Analytica, the data operation that allowed Trump to overperform the polls in the Rust Belt (Bannon sits on the board of Cambridge).

The difference between the Mercers and Bannon though is that I get the sense that the Mercers care more about maximizing the sum total of conservative-ness in the US government, while Bannon is on an ideological holy war. For instance, if Trump lost the nomination to Jeb!, then the Mercers probably would have made campaign donations to Jeb!'s campaign and PACs. *Breitbart* would probably have continued to lambast Hillary Clinton, but it would not have been as kind to Jeb! as it was to Trump, even during a general election."ddf35qy,1486427561,milehigh73,ddf7wfc,"&gt; I don't always agree with his methods or ideology, but goddamn the guy is a master class political savant who has his finger jammed directly into the pulse of the American public.

I do not think that bannon has the pulse of the american people. Trump lost the popular vote, and has encountered vast swathes of resistance to his policies and proposals, from the left and the right.

What he is very good at is dis-information, and manipulating the media. There is no one better at it than Bannon, certainly better than Rove.
