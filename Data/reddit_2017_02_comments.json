With each president the number of filibusters has increased since then.

[Let's start here:](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/18/steve-bannon-vows-economic-nationalist-movement-white-house-exciting-1930s-greater-reagan-revolution/)\n\n&gt; Like [Andrew] Jackson\u2019s populism\n\n&gt; trillion-dollar infrastructure plan\n\n&gt; It will be as exciting as the 1930s\n\nNevermind that he expresses admiration for Darth Vader or Satan in that Hollywood Reporter article (maybe he's trolling the fuck out of us, would be his style). But, some of this other stuff? Trillion-dollar spending plan? The 1930s? That shit was not exciting. It sucked. For a lot of people. Decent, common, hard-working Americans, getting fucked by the excesses of the 1920s. Not exciting. And it was a build-up to one of the most disastrous periods of human history. Maybe us liberals will get another New Deal out of it at least, after everyone decides they've had enough human misery. I mean, if we have the money to pay for a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan and all, then another New Deal doesn't sound so expensive. Maybe he's just trolling us here too. In which case, fuck him anyway for trolling. This isn't some Hollywood cocktail party where you go around trolling liberals and then snickering about it later. It's policy, and people's lives.\n\nThe weird thing is though, how unsure I am whether the guy is trolling or just has a very misinformed version of history. Again, from that article - Thomas Cromwell?  I mean, the guy was eventually beheaded, much to the rejoice of court. Just a weird person to compare yourself to.\n\nMore Bannon hate coming from me, let's pick some points out of [this Buzzfeed article:](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/this-is-how-steve-bannon-sees-the-entire-world?utm_term=.bqK6wAq1x0#.hjqDP49xXW)\n\nHe likens WWII to\n&gt; Judeo-Christian West versus atheists, right? \n\nThis gem:\n&gt; crony capitalism of people that are involved with these military powers-that-be in the government, and it forms a brutal form of capitalism that is really about creating wealth and creating value for a very small subset of people. \n\nDude's a part of an administration of billionaires, peddling clothing lines, and promising to roll back many of the restraints that protect the People against them.\n\n&gt; when capitalism was I believe at its highest flower and spreading its benefits to most of mankind\n\nColonialism? The slave-trade?\n\n&gt;  I can see this on Wall Street today \u2014 I can see this with the securitization of everything is that, everything is looked at as a securitization opportunity. People are looked at as commodities. I don\u2019t believe that our forefathers had that same belief.\n\nGod bless our founding fathers for the nation they built for us, but, they also owned people. Literally. \n\n&gt;  there are people in New York that feel closer to people in London and in Berlin than they do to people in Kansas and in Colorado\n\nProbably because they live similar lifestyles and perform similar functions within their societies. [This isn't really all that new either.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitanism). I'd imagine that rural folk from different countries feel the same way about each other.\n\nRick Perry and the DoE? The Trump presidency is really one big fuck-you to government. Is that what conservatism is? I mean, I guess the American Revolution was the ultimate fuck-you to the government, and we came out of that decently. You think Donald Trump, Steven Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway deserve to be in the same annals as George Washington? Maybe Andrew Jackson, which brings us to liberal outrage.\n\nAndrew Jackson presided over the Trail of Tears. In fact, Donald Trump has a lot of striking parallels to Andrew Jackson - definitely not a soldier, but, at least, star of The Apprentice! It's hard not to be completely outraged at the idea of something similar happening again. Human misery and all. And yet, we've got an administration EXPLICITLY targeting legal residents because of their religious affiliation. I mean, talk about what the founding fathers would or wouldn't have wanted. I dunno man, the whole American mythos is built largely on the idea of Pilgrims, Puritans, etc escaping religious persecution. I mean, how can you not feel a bit of patriotism when people get out and peacefully protest the execution of un-American actions by the current administration. Fuck the government, right? I mean, when the current administration wittingly invokes the imagery of the 1930s? Persecuting a religious group? IT. IS. SCARY. And absolutely deserving of active protest. BTW, the apocalyptic reaction [is not exclusive to the left](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/18/thats-how-dictators-get-started-mccain-criticizes-trump-for-calling-media-the-enemy/?utm_term=.e68e7770d33e).\n\nYou know, at first, I was on the fence about it too. About the protests, backlash. So I've tried to stay as informed as I can, and, even as a liberal, I'll tell you [I've remained incredibly skeptical of the mainstream media](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-brian-williams-has-lied-about-2015-2). \n\nOh, and that NYT article. I read it when it came out. I remember thinking, man, I wish there were a very polite, magnanimous way of telling someone to maybe, just a little bit, swallow their pride, and admit that they made a poor choice. And, to be honest, voting for Trump might not have actually been the worst choice ever. You read it on reddit, you hear it from business leaders, politicians, about a class of people being left behind by the successes and globalization of the last couple of decades. This was that class of people letting their voice be heard. If voting for Trump was that voice, then disavowing him and his cronies will be the best thing that class of people can do.

Sanders refused to condemn the decision. He was \u201cnot an expert in Nicaragua\u201d and \u201cnot a Nicaraguan,\u201d he said during a press conference. \u201cAm I aware enough of all the details of what is going on in Nicaragua to say \u2018you have reacted too strongly?\u2019 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d But of course he did know, later saying that the Sandinistas\u2019 [Ortega's party] brutal crackdown \u201cmakes sense to me.\u201d\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; To underscore his point, Sanders would usually indulge in counterfactual whataboutism: \u201cIf we look at our own history, I would ask American citizens to go back to World War II. Does anyone seriously think that President Roosevelt or the United States government [would have] allowed the American Nazi Party the right to demonstrate, or to get on radio and to say this is the way you should go about killing American citizens?\u201d [...]\n\n&gt; Or how about the Reagan counterfactual: \u201cWhat would President Reagan do if buildings were being bombed? If hospitals were being bombed? If people in our own country were being killed? Do you think President Reagan would say, \u2018of course we want the people who are killing our children to get up on radio and explain to the citizens of the country how they are going to kill more of our people?\u2019\u201d\n\n&gt; Or perhaps Abraham Lincoln can convince you: \u201cHow many of you remember what happened in the American Civil War and Abraham Lincoln\u2019s feeling about how you have to fight that war?

How much more can you expand gun rights when you've got concealed carry in 42 states?\n\n&gt; remove regulations regarding to small businesses (ongoing)\n\nAgain, how is this ongoing?\n\nAre you referring to the \"repeal 2 regulations to create 1\"? If so, that will do nothing for small business and is just a ruse. Access to loans and people willing and able to buy is what small businesses need, not some vague EO that can be interpreted however you like and provides nothing of substance for small businesses. It's another mirage.\n\n&gt; pull out of the TPP (done)\n\nThis is one thing he did do. Sadly though, it will probably still happen but with China at the helm, which won't be good for the US. But a lot of people disliked the TPP for some reason (still not sure why), so you have a victory there.\n\n&gt;  restore the balance of the Supreme Court \n\nWhat is this even supposed to mean?

How is making it 5-4 going to bring balance? \n\n&gt; approve the Keystone Pipeline (done)\n\nHe did remove the requirements for environmental studies to smooth the way for this. So I'd call that ongoing, if not done.\n\n&gt; restrict immigration (ongoing)\n\nThis is ongoing, but can you say it's going well? It is a mess. If he wanted to do this right, he could have. But he issued a hasty EO and have to have another go at it. Ongoing, sure, but going well - I don't think so.\n\n&gt; I'm far, far happier with this admin than I would have Hillary Clinton's\n\nThat's surely true, because Hillary would have been more of the same.\n\nHowever, even though you're clearly pretty enthusiastic about Trump, I think you need to go a little deeper than the headlines. Your very positive list of Trump's accomplishments vanishes if you look at this stuff for more than a minute or so. It's not that hard - you can't blame the biased media for your ignorance either, because Trump is either leading the repeal of ACA or isn't (he isn't) and he's either restoring balance to the Supreme Court or noth (can't see how he is)."}

How's a comedy program going to keep up with it? As soon as Fox News turns it into the nightly news, it's no longer (intentional) satire and no longer fertile ground for comedians to poke fun at it.

People come out of these protests with connections, with literature and reading lists, new facebook friends, new ideas, and an expanded tactical vocabulary.\n\nHe also severely misses the mark with this \"exercise catharsis and emotional release\" idea. Sure, those elements are there, but this suggests that the emotions are gone afterwards. Quite the opposite, protests have the effect of firing up and mobilizing the participants, even on an individual level without the networking effect mentioned above. Participating in a protest is extremely energizing. Sure you get your rage or sorrow out as well, but the wells those emotions flow from are in turn filled with camaraderie and optimism that you take back home with you.\n\nEven with the so-called \"fringe\" he complains about, he misses the point of their actions, which is to draw out state repression and expose the threat of violence quietly backing all the barricades and \"free speech zones\" which serve to curate and limit protest so as to be ineffective and non-disruptive as possible. \n\nAltogether, Frum's view seem to be a handful of permutations of \"the point of protests is to convince me you're the good guys.\" which I don't think could be further from the truth.

Because many do not know how to interpret this new form of media other than how it is presented, it can quickly lead to herd mentality which can lead to echo chambers and social/political divides.  The breaking point, of course, is when violent individuals meet other violent individuals within these divides.\n\nIt probably also doesn't help that the main news networks treat social media as if they represent all of society and thus, gives them a larger role in shaping the overall narrative.  This only makes it easier for protestors to rally when you have \"fake news\" or popular internet 'narratives/counter-narratives' being treated on the same playing field as professionally written and researched news.\n\nEssentially, the \"mainstream media\" misinterprets media themselves, of which makes it easier for others to do so.  \n\nOf course, that's not to say 'news' doesn't happen unless they are reported by an official source.  Obviously not.  Rather, it's to say that if you carelessly drive a narrative (especially ones where the sky is falling if 'xyz' conditions are met), people will react without critical thought.\n\nTo fix this, news networks and newspapers need to hold themselves more accountable for accurate news and perceived biases.

The better question is how can they get caught?  There is no check if you are the person you claim to be and no evidence to identify you later if you aren't.  Look at who is caught for voter fraud - people that moronically vote multiple times under their own name or people that vote multiple times with absentee ballots, that's it.

Like, if I don't care about solving starving children in Africa just this second because we have bigger problems here, or I don't care if Texans can own machine guns because California has problems of it's own, is that evil?\n\nBtw, going back to slavery - Alabama wanted to force New York to return escaped slaves, and to enforce slavery laws while slave masters were traveling in the north, and **the south** decided to seceede - Abraham Lincoln was **willing to compromise** with the south, the Confederacy left. So even your example is bad, New York never forced the south to do anything, until war was declared.\n"}

And also because many of the people in charge at the local and state level just do not care about the problems of poor people.\n\n&gt; Secondly, the services are affordable and the delivery fees are normally around $10.\n\n$40/month just to have the privilege of buying food is a significant additional bill for many people. This is \"affordable\" to you. Perhaps not for someone making $1000/month or less.\n\n&gt; If there is a single, disabled, low-income mother how is she getting her food now?\n\nTake the bus to the grocery store. Or walk, if it's within a mile.\n\n&gt; Does she get her food at a corner-store less than a mile away from her house?\n\nQuite possibly. A lot of corner stores are getting more grocery storeish as a consequence. Prices are still high though.\n\n&gt; How is she able to get there, and not get to a super market a little further?\n\nMan what's the big deal between walking one mile to the grocery store and walking two? It's only one extra mile (each way...).\n\n&gt; Does she order pizza or other unhealthy food?\n\nYes, increasingly people living in food deserts are having to turn to fast food restaurants in the area to eat. Especially the very low cost ones. This is likely to have a long-term knock-on effect since it means they're not passing on cooking skills (or the cooking inclination) to their children.\n\n&gt; You're right, the free market does not always provide good outcomes for everyone, but nothing does.\n\nIt's society's responsibility to minimize the damage when markets don't work well."}

There was a point where he was just a business guy and tv celeb. And it coincided with a time where social media and information exchange wasn't as matured. I don't really feel like many people hated him at this time, those that did came from a small pool of candidates.\n\nNow he's genuinely despised by half of the country since he directly impacts the lives of the people in the US and across borders. Negative allegations and perceptions, sexual misconduct or speaking in poor taste, racism/prejudice, conflict of interest, etc... social media is ablaze with Trump negatives every second. I can also see how this could cause a declining trend in sales to anything with his name. Which justifiably would warrant removing a product off the shelf.\n\nI'm trying to be impartial about it, but I do believe this is probably a case of discrimination due to association.\n\nIf I had a successful PR firm and people found out my last name was Hitler, I guarantee a few businesses would sever ties with me.

I would argue (and I have a strong suspicion that every Court in the country would agree with me) that limiting firearms sales to only permanent residents, citizens, or other groups of people who are going to live in the United States for a long time is a \"reasonable regulation.\" Background checks intended to ensure that guns aren't sold to people with violent histories are considered a reasonable regulation. I would argue that sales limiting ownership to only people in the US permanently are \"reasonable\" because we may not be able to access the kind of information necessary to determine if they have a suitable background for gun ownership if they are only in the US on a tourist visa. Additionally, it seems to be (though I'm not 100% sure on this one) that requiring people to get firearms safety certifications before they can own a gun is \"reasonable.\" It would be difficult to imagine that a person on a tourist visa could obtain the necessary certification in the amount of time they would have in the US.

But it's also wrong for a state to force them to live under them. Under the current state of affairs someone is always being immoral. The solution is to allow anarchists to live in hospitable land that does not receive any benefits from the state, nor does the state have any power in that area. \n\nAs for your capitalism comment: You said that you can not want to live under capitalism but capitalism can still be voluntary.

Much of my family (Protestants) sort of see pregnancy as you describe, but I (Catholic) have come to see pregnancy as something much more awe-inspiring, beautiful, and a blessing.\n\nI'll grant that many fellow Catholics would agree with you there, but from what I've studied, Catholic theology is much more nuanced on sexual issues than merely seeing sex as purely utilitarian. It's a bit wordy, but St. Pope John Paul II's *Theology of the Body* excellently describes sex as both good due to procreation as well as the emotional bond it creates between the married couple:\n\n&gt;The marriage act\u2026\u2019 at the same time \u2018unites husband and wife in the closest intimacy\u2019 and together makes them capable of generating new life.\u2019 Both the one and the other happen \u2018through the fundamental structure.\u2019 Since this is so, then it follows that the human person (with the necessity proper to reason, logical necessity) must read at the same time the \u2018twofold significance of the marriage act\u2019 and also the \u2018inseparable connection between the unitive significance and the procreative significance of the marriage act. Here we are dealing with nothing other than reading the language of the body in truth.\n\nSo essentially, the focus between the two groups are seperated based on how sex as an act is viewed in the first place; Catholicism teaches how awesome and beautiful it is (aka it's good) while many other Christians (some Catholics included) just see sex as you say and practically demonize it."}

Interventions in Latin America all succeeded in creating US allies and markets for US goods, the only real failures were Cuba and Venezuela, but Cuba is coming around and Venezuela has basically collapsed. In the Middle East intervention has not been as good at securing US interests but it has been very good at stopping the nations of the region from growing more powerful on a global scale. In Asia we had many less visible successes originating with our aid in opening Japan and China to the US and the west in general and the freeing of the Philippines from Spanish rule, more recently you may remember the US stopping Japanese expansion and the US's prevention of Korea from falling into the hands of communists. Many will point out Vietnam as a failure but the US killed millions of communists/communist sympathizer sand managed to evacuate a large number of anti-communists before the nation fell. In Africa US intervention lead partially to the fall of the northern pirate states and the death of a number of authoritarian rulers which helped stopped their nations from expanding their influence. In Europe US interventionism is most visible, the US intervened in WW2 freeing much of Europe from totalitarian rule."}

Because it is an interview, he can say basically anything and the New Yorker doesn't have to fact check or confirm - it's pure commentary and opinion by someone whose claim to fame is ghostwriting Trump's book. \n\nLiterally the only thing the New Yorker had to check was that Schwartz did in fact ghostwrite Trump's book. All of the rest can be fabricated by Schwartz whether it's good or bad opinion on Trump. What's better yet, Trump can't sue Schwartz because it's an opinion piece . And he obviously can't sue the New Yorker because all they did was interview.     \n\nSchwartz is in bed with Facebook and many other silicon valley politically left companies that fully supported Hillary as his biggest customers. It says so in the New Yorker article. He has a vested bias and financial interest in politically discrediting Trump.  He's not some small time writer. He got big since 1987, that's a long time ago and a lot of time he could have come forward with this information. But he didn't because it didn't benefit him to until now. And who knows if it's true?    \n\nIf anything it shows that in 1987 Schwartz was willing to sacrifice his own integrity for payment/money via Trump's book. People rarely change in this regard. He likely is sacrificing his integrity for money still."}

{"parent_id":"5tzyl0","created_utc":"1487176110","author":"georgiedawn","id":"dds2kvc","body":"Political parties are not inherently good or bad. They just do what is essential for them to survive, and for this we need to talk about power. Everything I'm writing now is universal, like evolution. All mammals essentially practice the behaviors.\n\nIf you ever live in a society with more than one person, you need power. Power is what gives your decisions higher priority than another person. In order to enact policies that you think are important (ie. climate change legislation), you need to be in power.\n\nHowever, no one inherently has power. All people who wants to have power always needs supporters, because power is contractual. The President has power becasue we gave him power based on his promises during the campaign. In non-democracies, a ruler has power because people tacitly consents to him to being in power; if he violates that contract, the peopel will rise up and get rid of him (ex. Tsar Nicholas II). Same thing in animal kingdom: the strongest often has more power because he can provide others with more food/defend the tribe. When he gets sick, a younger animal will seize power. So you need to have supporters that grant you power. In a society, technically everyone that can vote is a supporter in name; lets call them the nominal selectorate.\n\nThe thing is not everyone has an equal voice. Some people are worth more than other people: having the support of Ted Turner is incredibly powerful because he can make CNN blast out anti-Trump messaging, which is far more influential than having the support of your average Joe Schmo. Likewise, having the support of a billionaire means you will have access to unlimited superPAC funds. Thus, from a numbers game, it is not only more efficient, it also makes more sense to reach out to those people. This is why Clinton or Obama fundraises with wealthy donors; because their support is more important than the average citizens. This is also why during the campaign, they did their best to influence the electoral college, because they are the ones who actually cast the vote. They didn't need to influence the entire college - Trump never reached out to Democrat senators; you only need the number that is essential to win power; let's call them the winning coalition.\n\nThe problem is those people who are influential are also in their own positions of power. They also require the support of those under them (such as the Board of Directors if it's a CEO). And likewise the Board of Directors needs the support of other people so they remain on the Board. So power is an endless chain of who supports who.\n\nThe big question is why would someone support you over another contender. It's because they give something back that would help THEM remain in power. So to be in power, you have to hand out to your supporters things that will benefit them. A politician will enact policies favorable to his voter base - Democrats support Afro-American causes to get Black people's support, Trump supported the wall to get support. But more importantly, they will also do projects that are critical to the influential base. Palin supported the Bridge to Nowhere because it got her support from Ketchikan, an critically important district for her Governship bid. It doesn't matter if policies are smart; only that it is essential for political survival. Even people like you do this all the time; you support your friends so that they like you (after all you are friends) and that gives you influence among that group.\n\nSo back to political parties, they aren't inherently good or bad. By natural selection, they have to be more oriented towards the survival of the party or else they lost influence. That's why the Democrats/Republicans are in positions of power whereas the Green Party never gets into power. The former cares about their own survival. In order to do that, they need to address the interests of their voter group, specifically the winning coalition. Sometimes that overlaps with society, yet sometimes it doesn't.\n\nIf you're more curious about this btw, in poltical science, this is called selectorate theory. It's incredibly robust and well respected by political scientists. These practices are what happens in the real world situations among businessmen and politcians; you can see it everyday but hopefully it now makes sense. \n\nThis also explains much of the 'crazy' things the Trump administration has been doing. Trump doesn't necessarily believe the crazy acts he does but he needs the support of Bannon because he rules Brietbart, a media outlet. He also does things that support McConnell, Ryan and Fox News to get conservative voters. Ironically, what would help Trump not be crazy is if people had taken him seriously during the primaries; due to his inability to get mainstream Republicans to support him, he had to switch his source of power to the more radical wings. But the attacks by the MSM will now further force him to isolate himself as the only people supporting him will be the more extreme Trump suporters."}

I support freedom of expression and gender expression falls into that somewhat, but I don't support a singular authoritarian categorization of how gender works enacted with the experience of an ultra-minority in mind to work as law over the experience of the ultra-majority. \n\nAmong other things it leads to violent disagreement with people who just want to ask questions about the ideology that supports and buffets the concept of being transgender. If that ideology is internally inconsistent, which discussions with transgender people lead me to be believe, *and* externally inconsistent, meaning that no one can come to a complete consensus on the subject of being transgender, then there's all kinds of problems for everyone. That's what we're currently experiencing in society, now. \n\n&gt; Can't you see how social non-acceptance has a far greater and far more negative effect on the lives of trans people than our asking you for tolerance has on yours?\n\nI can, but I can also wonder aloud why someone who is totally convinced of their being better suited to the other biological gender in their mind is not also prepared to deal with the fact that what they're saying might not mesh at all with how other people conceive of gender. What makes your ideology better suited to the facts: social, biological, or otherwise, than anyone else's? So much of what I see in transgender discourse is a reliance on describing how the norms of gender work for everyone, so that they can explain their exact relationship to them: but if people can't even agree that those norms necessarily exist in the way you explain, then we all have a problem.

He needed Liebermans vote, and Lieberman refused to vote for the public option.\n\nI dont know enough about south American policies to comment on this.\n\nSimilarly, the stimulus package needed Republican support, and they wouldn't vote for it without tax cuts. It was about doing what needs to be done. And as a Keynesian, I consider tax cuts to be an effective way to do expansive fiscal policy, as long as it's followed up by tax increases when the economy is thriving (unfortunately not likely).\n\nThe groundworks for ISIS was created by the Bush administration. Going in with military force would only have served to put gasoline on the fire.\n\nI can't deny that Democrats lost seats, but that was a problem with incompetent leadership of the Democratic party and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, more than it was the fault of Obama as a president (though I definitely admit he bears some responsibility).\n\nOverall I am quite satisfied with his terms, given the hand he was dealt."}

Trump's rejection of those norms are likely to have lasting effects (best case) and may actually lead him to fundamentally re-order the state to grant himself more power (worst case).  I also personally think the erosion of those norms are far more destructive to liberty than, e.g., a 3% increase in top marginal tax rates, but I suppose we'd have to agree to disagree there.\n\nI stand by my basic point that libertarians are vastly underestimating the downside risk with Trump due to a failure of imagination, but I can see why you might think you'll come out ahead."}

Thus the trade-off is seen as worthwhile by some. We view the costs as outweighing the benefits and we additionally suppose that people should be free first to *choose* whether they adopt a harmful practice to their person. That's not an instance of an objective standard, just a (agreeable) principle that we have of avoiding unnecessary harm. That principle is useful in a slew of other applications so we adhere to it more universally and to the detriment of other cultural adaptions made by other societies. \n\n&gt;so as a society we instead try to encourage acceptance of a broader range of healthy body figures.\n\nWho is \"we as a society?\" I personally don't believe that there is really a broad definition of a \"healthy\" body figure. Most bodies are objectively unhealthy to varying degrees, and only athletes are ever in the best possible shape for a human body. Even professional athletes are variously unsuited to physical activity that they don't practice for. Therefore encouraging people to simply expand what they label \"healthy\" behavior and body shape is merely a psychological exercise in short term self-satisfaction. It's akin to telling people who smoke cigarettes that everyone loses their breath sometimes, and that people simply have a limited scope of lung capacity acceptance, so it's ok to keep smoking. This seems to be rooted in a principle of total Permissiveness, which isn't necessarily a principle who's expansion to universality nets objective improvement in the whole of society. \n\n\n&gt;It's not just that one opinion is better than the other - We know to the best of our current understanding that one path leads to better life outcomes than the other.\n\nI don't think we necessarily \"know\" one way of doing things is better than another. We certainly *believe* that one way can be better, but we often also lack the real perspective on the facts of the matter to *know* it for certain. This is why so many cultural distinctions exist between human societies, even today. Norms are not all equally good and useful, nor equally as rational: but to a large extent they are arbitrary to one another and arise out of unique historical circumstances in a given geography. They can be changed back and forth, preserved or destroyed. The point being that there is no obvious lineage of \"progress\" that can be studied in how the whole of humanity lives. Merely the disconnected lineages of different organizing principles which vary in their usefulness and reproducibility from generation to generation. \n"}

Who's to blame for committing rape? The rapist or the woman? The answer is, and always is, that it's the rapist's fault for committing rape. If a woman dresses provocatively and drinks until she passes out at a college party, she didn't \"incite\"\n the man to rape her. The rapist chose to commit a crime, and he should be held accountable for his own actions. It boggles my mind how some on the left can simultaneously say that a rapist is to blame for rape, but the violent anti-Trump protesters are not responsible for their own actions, because they inspired by someone else.

He also still does significantly better with online and robo caller polls than live interview polls as he did in the campaign, suggesting the shy Trump factor still remains.\n\n\nSo while Trump may be \"historically\" unpopular at this stage of the Presidency, he's not that unpopular at all, the public is about divided 50/50 on him, so he won't be bad for Republicans in the midterms if this keeps up"}

I don't think deregulating back to the Bush-era is going to help. Health insurance unfortunately doesn't exactly follow typical free market practices and insurance premiums were rising back then, too. Can we afford not to fix our health care? The taxes our government currently spends on health care is literally greater than the amount it would cost to cover everyone 100% if we had another country's plan. \n\nSame with college. The first step to collecting taxes is having taxable incomes in the first place. A high-school education job these days often does not pay very well, and it's not going to get any better. Skipping college can significantly lower the amount of income someone brings in for their entire lives, and really slashes the amount of taxes they pay. Long term food stamp recipients are likely to not have a college degree, and unemployment numbers are ridiculously high for those without college degrees. Without college (or trade school) I would argue we're training a workforce for the 20th century, and that leaves us noncompetitive globally.\n\n[BLS:](https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm)\n&gt;5.4% unemployment : High School Diploma $638 weekly earnings\n\n&gt;2.8% unemployment : Bachleor's Degree  $1,137 weekly earnings (roughly 80% higher income)\n\nWhat's going to happen when we have even more automation down the line and people don't have the skills to get new jobs? Our society won't be the same when we have small amounts of people  bringing in millions each year and others making just $30k. I am honestly fearful of how many more people are going to be on food stamps in the coming decades once their job gets automated. Those future costs can be mitigated by sending them to college now, and their children may also become more likely to go to college since their parents went.\n\nOne day we may not import as many skilled immigrants as we do, and we're going to start to rely on natural born innovation even more. Elon Musk could have immigrated to China instead of the United States, and then they would have Tesla and SpaceX. \n\nBeing poor (especially when growing up) can really put a hamper on innovation and school performance. UBI (just as food stamps do) help ensure more Americans get the chance to become a next great innovator.\n"}

If, in 200 years, a good amount of today's progressive positions, become so mainstream, that to deny them would be considered absurd, what do you think the steps to get there would look like?

I don't often find reasonable sounding conservatives on the internet and I really want to understand core principles and beliefs of the people with whom I disagree. (I was once full on hard libertarian myself, but I've lost touch with that thought process because my friends and acquaintances either all went the same way I did or are just gun happy idiots.)\n\n**Drugs:** hard to argue with this one. Legalize, regulate, tax. With the right infrastructure (licensed shops/better funded emergency services/etc.) even harder drugs could be okay. \n\n**Guns:** on one hand, we're probably never going to agree on the necessity of allowing firearms to be owned privately, nor am I going to be able to understand why you'd want or need an automatic rifle to begin with. I think we will just have fundamentally different interpretations of the 2nd amendment. That said, I think it's important that the cost/difficulty of entry into the ownership of automatic weapons is inhibitively high, for general public safety reasons. If you, in the interest of public safety, to bring the cost down but the difficulty up to compensate, how would you like to do that and how would you fund that infrastructure? Alternatively, if you would just prefer to lower the bar and increase the availability and therefore sheer numbers of automatic weapons, why?\n\n**Tobacco:** at this point I don't think the warning labels are ever going away since taking them off packages would result in very winnable lawsuits by tobacco induced cancer patients claiming they didn't have enough warning to know they'd get cancer. As for restaurants, I agree that standalone bars and restaurants should have the discretion to allow or disallow smoking. However, I don't think smoking in restaurants will ever make a comeback if the chef/owner has any aspirations of upward and outward growth. Bars are whatever in my mind; nobody goes out drinking to be healthy. \n\n**Drinking age:** 100% agree. An adult is an adult and should have the full rights of an adult, whatever that age may be. Drinking, smoking, serving in the military, whatever, 18 is adult enough IMO. (Maybe driving also, but that's my personal opinion.)\n\n**Free trade:** this is the one I want most to discuss. In my view, taking into consideration advances in medicine, robotics, and other technologies, we need to change how we look at the system of humanity. Until now, using the Industrial Age mindset focused solely on growth was great and no doubt got us to where we are today. However, I feel that particularly with the coming wave of automation that the human system, ever growing technology and invention, has reached a kind of saturation point where we achieved the ultimate goal of technology in the first place: to make human life easier with minimal work so that more time can be spent focusing on art, music, and recreation. \n\nNonstop focus on growth for the sake of growth will do nothing but drain the worlds resources to nothing while perpetuating human suffering. In this day and age I believe it is time to start focusing on the human part of the system, stop worrying about growth and instead on sustainability and happiness. And it's not like technological progress will just stop either; rather, refocusing on intellectual and technological growth in the world will take us to the stars, to the end of hunger and war. It ~~sounds~~ is naive and utopian but the only reason we all struggle so hard is that a few wealthy bureaucrats feel the need to compete with each other and keep everyone else down, and have thoroughly convinced the world that this is the way things must be. \n\nTherefore, the arguably negligible systemic growth that can be achieved by gifting huge amounts of power to corporations through laws like NAFTA and the TPP is not worth supporting, and I'd like to know why you think it is. \n\n**Intervention:** with the economy becoming ever more globalized, I think it is time for the world's governments to get with the times. The UN needs more support from the world, more funding, and more autonomy. The concepts of nationalism and countries in general are outdated in my opinion. For bureaucratic purposes - governing, funding, elections, and the like - divisions are necessary for humanity to function properly but again, I will never be able to have any enthusiasm or fight on behalf of the greed of rich bureaucrats and fat cats. \n\nWith proper funding and international support, the UN could deal with civil wars and various human atrocities swiftly and diplomatically. \n\nI'd really like your more philosophical view on the world in regard to these things and anything else you might have to say.

We need to consider that as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bernie beat Hillary on head for her vote on Iraq war. She was a senator of NY at that time. Would Bernie have voted against it if he was a senator of NY? \n\nGood point. I assume he only could succeed at his schtick in Vermont. I don't think he would have voted for the Iraq war, though, even as a senator in NY. If anything, he would either have not been elected in the first place or would soon be ousted from office following his inevitable vote against the war. My point is that that integrity is what makes him appealing to voters in the first place, which is why I think he functions best as an Independent. It allows him to speak his mind and appear not beholden to special interests/party lines (a big theme this election cycle).\n\nI also didn't claim that he is unwilling to compromise. He did endorse Clinton after all, even to the chagrin of his more extreme supporters. [He also passed more roll call amendments under Republican control than any other senator for about eight years.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/24/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-was-roll-call-amendment-king-1995-2/) To me, that isn't indicative of someone who isn't willing to compromise. Unlike the Republican \"Party of 'No'\", Sanders actually has a vision for what he wants to accomplish. That's an important distinction, to me.\n\nI agree that he likely couldn't achieve 90% of what he espouses (especially after the conservative meltdown over the ACA), but that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive for them. As a corollary, I think that also means we should speak openly about our goals, even if they are not politically feasible at the moment. Just because the politics are such that single payer healthcare is almost certainly an impossibility right now doesn't mean it's a bad platform to run on and push for."}
