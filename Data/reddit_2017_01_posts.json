I am refering to, of course, the Globalism vs Nationalism argument that has taken up some new traction lately. \nWith people like Donald Trump winning seats of major power, and with the UK voting to leave the EU, what will this mean for the world? Is it likely to leave a lasting impact? I'd love for the input of as many people as possible, and I'd love to hear everyone's personal opinions on it as well, and why they don't agree with the other side. \n\nAlso, consider the element of what Globalism and Nationalism mean today, compared to what they meant in the near or distant past. \n\nThanks all!"}

The Republicans [might not have the votes](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/obamacare-repeal-might-have-just-died-tonight.html).\n\nLet's assume that the GOP can't marshal enough votes in the House or Senate to repeal the ACA without having a suitable replacement in place. (A replacement that is likely to cause more squabbling and dissent.)\n\nOnce Trump is sworn in as President, how much would he be able to do without Congress? Could he issue executive orders on the subject that would effectively repeal the ACA? Or would he be limited to meeting with dissenting Senators in the hopes that he could pressure them to fall in line?"}

Republicans will be confronted on their support for Donald Trump (who lost resoundingly among NYC voters) while De Blasio (and other Democratic challengers) will be hit over questions of whether or not they can actually deliver on their rhetoric. \n\nDe Blasio also faces questions over things like failing to call the recent NYC bombs an act of \"terror\" (even though his Democratic colleague, Governor Cuomo, had no such qualms); questioning the integrity of his own police department; and a handful of other issues (potentially using his influence to get a friend released from police custody; programs to help the homeless which have seen tremendous faults and anger from homeless and non-homeless advocates alike; etc). However, reports indicate he may have personally preferred Bernie Sanders, meaning he wasn't necessarily part of the Democratic \"establishment\" image that the party is now trying to shed. Concerns raise over why he didn't state his positive thoughts about Sanders publicly, though. \n\nAll of these issues are a microcosm of the emotions felt throughout the country, although NYC is certainly a very different landscape. Republicans are likely to have a difficult time appealing to voters due to the stain that Trump has set on the Republican brand (with that stain being exceptionally and uniquely toxic in New York). But De Blasio, with approval ratings often below 50%, has challenges too.\n\nWhat do you expect to see in the next 10 months as this process unfolds?"}

Ideological sorting in the parties is relatively recent, could it be reversed via the primary system?\n\nIs it possible to mobilize liberal voters to participate in the Republican primaries to push moderates or even liberals? Is it possible for conservatives to mobilize to push moderate Democrats? \n\nThe numbers seem to favor this. Ted Cruz won his senate seat in the Republican Primary runoff with only about 600,000 votes in 2012 in Texas. His opponent, David Dewhearst got about 400K, for a total of 1 million votes cast in the Republican primary runoff.\n\nHillary and Bernie turned out 1.3 Million to vote in the Democratic Presidential primary race in 2016 in Texas.\n\nCan people look past their tribalism to work for a reasonable opposition? Is this beyond the pale and unsupportable by the parties themselves? The voter psychology seems to be the most difficult thing to overcome here. \n\nThe Tea Party managed to manipulate the primary system to push non-traditional business conservatives from office. Could the same tactic be used by organized groups in a different way, targeting extremists with marginal support and bringing reasonable moderates into power or at least into the general election?"}

Also, having a fully united government is a rare occasion; are the Republicans going to act as a united force to take advantage of this? Are there other forces at work?"}

How likely is it that intra-party dissension will delay a repeal?","selftext":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/repeal-affordable-care-act-donald-trump.html\n\n&gt; President-elect Donald J. Trump pressed Republicans on Tuesday to move forward with the immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act and to replace it very quickly thereafter, saying, \u201cWe have to get to business. Obamacare has been a catastrophic event.\u201d\n\n&gt; Mr. Trump\u2019s position undercuts Republican leaders who want a quick vote to repeal President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement but who also want to wait as long as two to three years to come up with an alternative. But he was also challenging the resolve of nervous Republicans in Congress who do not want any vote on a repeal until that replacement exists.\n\n&gt; Mr. Trump, who seemed unclear about the timing of already scheduled votes in Congress this week, demanded a repeal vote \u201cprobably some time next week,\u201d and said \u201cthe replace will be very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.\u201d\n\n&gt; That demand is very likely impossible. Republicans in Congress are nowhere close to agreement on a major health bill that would replace President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. A number of Republicans in the House and Senate have said publicly that they wanted to hold off on voting to eviscerate the health law until a replacement measure could be negotiated.\n\n&gt; For now, the Senate is planning to vote Thursday morning on a budget resolution that would set up parliamentary protections for a health care repeal bill that would have to emerge from House and Senate committees by Jan. 27. The House would vote on Friday if that budget measure clears the Senate.\n\n&gt; That plan is under pressure from Republicans who want to slow the process as they struggle for an agreement on what would follow repeal.\n\nThe Senators who want a replacement simultaneously with repeal are Rand Paul of Kentucky, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and Bob Corker of Tennessee. \n\nTrump appears to be siding with the Congressmen who want to repeal ACA, then propose a replacement afterwards. But with conflicting interests in the GOP, is it possible that the repeal is delayed indefinitely?"}

Wind and rain may be kept outside, but so is light and air.\"\n\nFree trade and globalization are major topics in the international political conversation at the moment, because of the UK's Brexit position, concerns over the eurozone, and President-Elect Trump's rhetoric on trade. With the US at least positioning itself to turn away from free trade, including rejecting the TPP, and China countering by pursuing the RCEP, could China's seeming defence of free trade have political consequences, both in the US and in Europe?\n\n* [Guardian summary of his speech](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/17/china-xi-jinping-china-free-trade-trump-globalisation-wef-davos)"}

How will this practically affect the beginning of his administration and its ability to implement policy, if at all?","selftext":"The Women's March on Washington is scheduled to take place the day after the inauguration, January 21. What began as a chiefly feminist endeavor has expanded to involve more than 200 anti-Trump groups covering pretty much every political issue you can think of. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend, with the organisers talking about 200,000 and police preparing for up to 400,000 marchers. For context, the 1963 March on Washington was estimated to involve 200,000 to 300,000 people.\n\nOn the same day, more than 300 'sister marches' are also scheduled in cities across the US and internationally, with an even greater number of people signed up to attend these events (nearing 700,000 at the time of writing). [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/14/womens-march-on-washington-protest-size-donald-trump) can give you some more background information about the March, if you're not aware of it already.\n\n*If* the March turns out to be nearly as large as people are expecting it to be, then it will be a historic and unprecedented show of defiance to a new President on his first full day in the White House. But what will it achieve? Will it shatter Trump's 'mandate'? Will it snuff out his momentum? Will it make vulnerable GOP members of Congress think twice about supporting Trump's agenda? Or will it just come and go, brushed out of the news cycle by the first set of rambling tweets from Trump's shiny new @POTUS account?"}

Well how did it actually work? Is it a success? Do the Plain Sneetches grudgingly accept and say, \"Ok, that was a good idea,\" or do they say it's the worst thing since changing dinner to supper? Or, was it something the Star-Bellied Sneetches were really proud of 15 years ago, but now they try to distance themselves from it?\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is I'm less worried about what Democrats say Republicans did wrong (and vice-versa), but about what Republicans (and Democrats) think/thought they did right and what the outcome was."}

This has happened in a broad variety of electoral systems:\n\n**Poland, 2015** - PiS wins a majority in the Sejm with 37.58% of the popular vote in a proportional representation system.\n\n**USA, 2016** - Donald Trump wins the presidency with ~46% of the PV in a series of 51 first-past-the-post elections (the electoral college). Republicans win the House and Senate with 49.1% of the popular vote in the House in a series of 435 FPTP elections (Senate is n/a because two Democrats ran against each other in California).\n\n**The Philippines, 2016** - Rodrigo Duterte wins the presidency with ~38% of the vote in a single FPTP election.\n\n**Hungary, 2014** - Fidesz wins a majority with ~45% of the vote in a mixed proportional-FPTP election.\n\n**Denmark, 2015** - DF acts as a *de facto* coalition partner, winning 21.1% of the popular vote in a proportional election (second place).\n\n**Finland, 2015** - Perussuomalaiset acts as a junior coalition partner, gaining 17.7% of the popular vote in a proportional election.\n\nAre some political systems more susceptible to right-wing/populist candidates? Na\u00efvely, it seems like the French two-round system might least friendly to such a party as it requires an absolute majority to win either the presidency or a given parliamentary seat."}

What factor(s) did these predictions fail to take into account?","selftext":"A lot of attention has been paid to the failure of the polls close to the election, which has largely been explained as a combination of an enthusiasm gap and polls' inherent margins of error. However, I remember that when Trump first entered the race, his candidacy was seen as a joke and his primary wins took people by surprise. When people dismissed his chances early in the 2016 election cycle, what caused them to so drastically underestimate how successful he would end up being? Did they overlook some trend in the American cultural zeitgeist that ran counter to what their gut instincts said?"}

Some of this has legitimate reasoning IMO. \n\nGenerally, a home (or in this case a condo) is the largest capital investment a person will ever make in their life. If I decide to build a landfill next to your condo and your property values go negative you are seriously fucked, not only in lost investment money, but now you can't move unless you can make up the difference between the low selling price and the actual mortgage cost which you probably don't have that lump sum lying around. Not being able to move severely limits your economic dynamism, which in turn makes it harder for you to adapt to sudden shifts such as long term job losses. As an example if you are a tech worker, and your SF condo went under water, and Silicon Valley suddenly packed up and moved to Cleveland you would be stuck with less job choices while everyone mobile now moves to Cleveland. This is how long term structural unemployment starts.\n\nOn the other hand lets not kid ourselves, a lot of this also has racial and class based undertones. Look no further than Georgetown in Washington DC. For those who don't know Georgetown is an area of DC known for high priced everything. Living there is basically the stamp of \"I am rich and superior to you\" Everything is overpriced, even the stupid cupcakes (I'm looking at you Georgetown Cupcakes). One of the interesting things about Georgetown, is that even though it is in the middle of the city, which, until it started breaking, and catching on fire, had decent subway lines to the point where people could afford to not have a car, Georgetown was always a pain in the ass to get to. Why? It has lobbied many times to prevent public transit from going directly to it. The unofficial reason that everyone in DC knows is that it is because they don't want \"those people\" (read black people, poor people etc) coming to their neighborhood. In short, in the extreme, zoning laws can be used to artificially inflate property values of people lucky enough to already live somewhere, and beyond the money, people love exclusivity. Who doesn't want to live in the \"cool\" neighborhood? In general I have found cool means it has cool stuff combined with it having limited housing supply making someone living there unique. This has the downside of inflating property values making a housing crunch like we are seeing in major coastal cities.\n\nWhat is the appropriate balance between these two extremes?"}

He wants to see all states by the end of the year. To me, that sounds a lot like the starting of a political campaign. Also, recently, court documents revealed that he has talked to Facebook's board about running for office. He hasn't disclosed his political party, but has given to both republicans and democrats; while repeatedly criticizing Donald Trump. Recently there has been numerous reports that he wants to be president. This definitely sounds like he will eventually run for office.  \n\nDo you see him running in the 2018 midterms? What political party? If not for the midterms, will he run for president against Trump in 2020? Do you think that he could possibly beat Trump, as they are both successful businessmen? \n\nLink for more: http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/01/04/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-political-ambitions/96161822/"}
{"id":"5o1svl","created_utc":"1484451458","author":"-7701-","title":"Uncertain Justice: Should the US adopt a policy of reparations for the overwhelming discrimination against blacks by federal and state governments?","selftext":"Reparations \u2013 it\u2019s a topic that stirs up emotions from the moment it\u2019s mentioned. When it comes to the policy of reparations, it\u2019s usually rebutted with \u201cthe Civil Was was 150 years ago\u201d or  \u201cWe\u2019ve moved on from racism of the 1950s\u201d. We may have, but are the effects still in having a profound impact on African Americans 2017?\nOne of the most powerful racist polices was redlining. It was a tool used by the FHA for 34 years (1934-68) that basically made homeownership accessible to whites and explicitly refused to back loans to black people or those that lived near black people. Yes, an outright policy of racism per The Atlantic:\n\n&gt;The FHA insured private mortgages, causing a drop in interest rates and a decline in the size of the down payment required to buy a house. But an insured mortgage was not a possibility for Clyde Ross. The FHA had adopted a system of maps that rated neighborhoods according to their perceived stability. On the maps, green areas, rated \u201cA,\u201d indicated \u201cin demand\u201d neighborhoods that, as one appraiser put it, lacked \u201ca single foreigner or Negro.\u201d These neighborhoods were considered excellent prospects for insurance. Neighborhoods where black people lived were rated \u201cD\u201d and were usually considered ineligible for FHA backing. They were colored in red. Neither the percentage of black people living there nor their social class mattered. Black people were viewed as a contagion. Redlining went beyond FHA-backed loans and spread to the entire mortgage industry, which was already rife with racism, excluding black people from most legitimate means of obtaining a mortgage. [Source]( https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/)\n\nAs you can see, the government was complicit in the creation of poor and crime ridden neighborhoods in favor of white, affluent ones. These policies extended to other benefits such as the GI Bill \u2013 where black veterans were typically shunned from low interest home loans.\n\nThese ripple effects was not limited to housing but infected schooling, business, employment, law and order. Blacks would be afflicted with poor education, be denied business, employment and still be brutalized by police which was only amplified by redlining. \n\nThis is on top of centuries of enslavement along with oppressive Jim crow racism and violence. Slavery was a key foundation for the American governmental system that it was founded upon and so it would be expected that a civil war would break out when something so ingrained would be fundamentally changed. \n\nWhen the 13th amendment passed, it prohibited slavery with an important exception:  involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime. This created a system of [convict leasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict_lease) where states essentially sold prison labor to private parties such as plantation owners. The selective and harsh enforcement of the laws resulted in overwhelming amount of black males being arrested and be a part of this convict lease system. By in large, the convict lease system exploited the exception in the 13th amendment to keep a form of slavery alive for the south.\n\nThe treatment of blacks was improving at an extremely marginal pace. The harsh treatment just has simply been more covert as time has passed. So instead of outright enslavement and convict leasing it became the revocation of rights, privileges and immunities, and a lot of things of everyday life enjoyed by their white counterparts.\n\n\nThen it slowly devolved to coded language as Lee Atwater explained:\n\n&gt;Atwater: You start out in 1954 by saying, \"N----r, N----r, N----r.\" By 1968 you can't say \"N----r\"\u2014that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me\u2014because obviously sitting around saying, \"We want to cut this,\" is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \"N----r,N----r.\n\n\nSo my question is this: Should the United States embark to make reparations as part of public policy?\n\nAs with the source linked above, I encourage you to read the article from the Atlantic for more insight on reparations: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"}

Polybius argued in his theory of Anacyclosis that three basic forms of government monarchy, aristocracy and democracy would in time decay into malignant forms of government tyranny, oligarchy and ochlocracy (mob rule). \n\n(More depth if you're interested) From Wikipedia :\nThe state begins in a form of primitive monarchy. The state will emerge from monarchy under the leadership of an influential and wise king; this represents the emergence of \"kingship\". Political power will pass by hereditary succession to the children of the king, who will abuse their authority for their own gain; this represents the degeneration of kingship into \"tyranny\".\n\nSome of the more influential and powerful men of the state will grow weary of the abuses of tyrants, and will overthrow them; this represents the ascendancy of \"aristocracy\" (as well as the end of the \"rule by the one\" and the beginning of the \"rule by the few\").\n\nJust as the descendants of kings, however, political influence will pass to the descendants of the aristocrats, and these descendants will begin to abuse their power and influence, as the tyrants before them; this represents the decline of aristocracy and the beginning of \"oligarchy\". As Polybius explains, the people will by this stage in the political evolution of the state decide to take political matters into their own hands.\n\nThis point of the cycle sees the emergence of \"democracy\", as well as the beginning of \"rule by the many\". In the same way that the descendants of kings and aristocrats abused their political status, so too will the descendants of democrats. Accordingly, democracy degenerates into \"ochlocracy\", literally, \"mob-rule\". During ochlocracy, according to Polybius, the people of the state will become corrupted, and will develop a sense of entitlement and will be conditioned to accept the pandering of demagogues.\n\nEventually, the state will be engulfed in chaos, and the competing claims of demagogues will culminate in a single (sometimes virtuous) demagogue claiming absolute power, bringing the state full-circle back to monarchy."}

Statistics also show that most cities also tend to vote democrat in elections. ([source: Pew research](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/21/the-growing-democratic-domination-of-nations-largest-counties/)) Because of this, some people think a popular vote system would be tyranny of the majority or \"mob rule\" since it would give cities and democrats an advantage population wise. These people worry that cities would dominate every election and that rural voters wouldn't ever have a say. \n\nIf we repeal the electoral college, should rural voters have increased representation (like having their votes count more) to prevent only cities from deciding? Or do those cities deserve to have more representation since a majority of Americans live in them? Do you agree or disagree that tyranny of the majority is a real problem in a popular vote system?

The Democratic firewall in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin fell while Trump ramped up the margins in supposedly swing states such as Ohio (8 point win) and Iowa (9 point win).\n\nOn the flip side, Democrats narrowed the gap in Texas down to 9 points. The [CNN exit polls](http://edition.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls/national/president) actually showed that while the youth vote (18-24 year olds) in the rust belt and Midwest were either split or in some cases slightly Pro Trump (such as Wisconsin and Minnesota), the Democrats dominated in many sun belt states with the youth. Some examples include, Texas, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, and Florida. In some of these states democrats won the 18-24 and 18-29 age groups by upwards of 30 percentage points. \n\n\n1.

In the event that they take the Senate back in 2018, I could easily see them blockading any vacancy that might arise between then and 2020.\n\nRepublicans, having faced no repercussions for keeping the Court at 8 justices for a year, would probably have no incentive not to go for two years if the situation were to arise again.\n\nHaving established that, I'm wondering if we'll ever see an attempted blockade of an entire 4 year term. It doesn't seem out of the question at all. I can easily see a scenario where if Dems took back the Senate in 2020 while Trump won reelection, they'd refuse to confirm anyone until 2024, particularly if they felt good about the 2022 midterms.\n\nFinally, if one vacant seat is acceptable for a year or more, would two or three vacant seats really be that much of a stretch?"}

The issue is that there aren't really any red-state Democrats up for election, but there are a host of blue and purple state Republican governors who will either be term-limited or up for reelection.\n\nTerm-limited:\nNew Jersey (Chris Christie),\nFlorida (Rick Scott),\nMaine (Paul LePage),\nMichigan (Rick Snyder),\nNevada (Brian Sandoval),\nNew Mexico (Susana Martinez),\nOhio (John Kasich)\n\nThere are also a lot of governors who aren't term-limited, but could lose given the fundamentals of their state if popular opinion turns against Trump:\n\nIllinois (Bruce Rauner),\nMaryland (Larry Hogan),\nMassachusetts (Charlie Baker),\nNew Hampshire (Chris Sununu),\nVermont (Phil Scott),\nWisconsin (Scott Walker)\n\nBaker in Massachusetts and Hogan in Maryland are two of the most popular governors in the country, so those mansions may not be winnable. But Rauner is very unpopular, Phil Scott is new, and Walker is controversial.\n\nThere's also the possibility that Dan Malloy could lose in Connecticut, as he is very unpopular, which would offset a Republican loss.\n\nI assume Dems would be the favorites in New Jersey, Maine, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Vermont unless Trump manages to be surprisingly popular. The others might be toss-ups, with Massachusetts and Maryland as long-shots.\n\n"}

Unlike that of Clear Channel when radio deregulated, neither company has gotten much press for their growth as minus a few cases their holdings miss the largest markets.\n\nRight now, both Sinclair and Nexstar are abutting the 39% of the US cap set by the FCC in 2003; this amount is not a true 39% as stations that were UHF prior to the digital transition still count as half a station versus analog-era VHF allocations. The speculation has been that a Republican-led FCC would further lift any caps (under Michael Powell/GWB it went from 35%) and possibly cancel a plan to sunset the UHF discount, however during the last Republican administration many groups shrunk in size including the aforementioned Sinclair and since Telcom 96 the pattern has been to buy big while Democrats are in power and digest/sell when Republicans are in power. [Sinclair was one of the groups to pay for greater access to the Trump administration](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-campaign-sinclair-broadcasting-jared-kushner-232764) so might they want the rules to be bent further their way even though they might not be able to properly run what they have?

This act by Congress requires only a simple majority (no filibuster in the Senate) in each house and is subject to a presidential veto.\n\nThere's a fact sheet about the CRA [here](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43992.pdf) and a pretty interesting WSJ article [here](http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-gop-regulatory-game-changer-1485478085).\n\nThe concern with this Act is that it appears there were many Obama executive actions that fall under the definition of \"rule\" in the CRA, but for which reports weren't submitted. The Trump administration could then submit reports for these actions, giving Congress 60 days to overturn the regulation.  This might not be too bad, executive agencies undo executive work all the time, except 801(b)(2) provides:\n\n&gt;A rule that does not take effect (or does not continue) under paragraph (1) may not be reissued in substantially the same form, and a new rule that is substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued, unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.\n\nSo if Congress undoes an Obama-era rule this way, no future administration can re-enact that rule unless they can get legislation passed through Congress.\n\nDo you think this is a tool Republicans will actually use? Or will Obama's executive actions be sufficiently popular to protect them?\n\nEDIT: Mods, feel free to change the flair, Legal/Courts, US Politics, Legislation all seem like they could be appropriate."}

What groups could these be?\n\nIf the above question is uninteresting: feel free to instead discuss what happens if this dynamic continues. ex. Does the GOP become like the pre-Johnson Democratic Party? ( held together not by ideology: see Solid South) \n\n\nEDIT: To get a sense of the trend I'm talking about: [Here's a picture of Ohio over the past 20 years. As well as charts on how vote shifted across rural, small town, small city, large city categories.](http://imgur.com/a/z05p2)\n\n[Images lifted from this article/series](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/01/19/how_trump_won_the_midwest_132834.html)"}

I'll explain in detail:\n\n**Gun Rights**\n\nHardiman authored an opinion in  Drake v. Filko that took an expansive view towards gun rights. Basically he states that the 2A protects gun rights beyond the home (a question left unanswered by the SCOTUS in Heller).\n\n**1st Amendment**\n\n\nHowever he follows the path of William Rehnquist with respect to free speech rights - wherein that he favors restrictions to it:\n\nIn  Easton Area School District v. B.H. (The \"I [Heart] Boobies\" bracelet case) where he dissented writing that the speech falls into a gray area of \"lewdness\".\n\nPerhaps more troubling is his view on recording the police. In Kelly v. Borough of Carlisle, he wrote that due to insufficient case law, the recording of police was not justified by the 1A. This is a troubling view that indicates his potential skepticism of first amendment rights as the broader third circuit has embraced this opinion and concluded that videotaping without an expressive purpose may not be protected.\n\n**4th Amendment**\n\nHardiman ruled in favor of the gov't in  Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders (later upheld by 5-4 SCOTUS) that upheld strip searches of arrestees even if there is no basis to strip search.\n\nWith that being said, I have two questions:\n\n* Do you support a justice with the views annotated above?\n* If you are a general supporter of expansive view of rights/freedom enshrined by the constitution, is it worth the the narrowing of 1st/4th amendment rights in favor of expansive 2nd amendment rights?"}
