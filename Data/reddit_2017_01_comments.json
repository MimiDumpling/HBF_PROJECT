We use that whenever another democrat comes out with a hateful race baiting line about how \"-ist\" people in this country are and how the tactics used by people like Waters and Lewis are right in line with what caused the Dems to lose over 1000 state and federal elected positions in the 2016 election year. \n\n&gt;What did Trump learn from Obama?\n\nExactly what not to do.\n\n&gt;At some point we need to decide what really lost the election because if Hillary was the problem then with her not there anymore it shouldn't be an issue. If it is something else we need specifics not just \"out of touch\".\n\nElitism, the moral superiority complex, the hate, the bigotry, the racism, the lack of meaningful action. The only people voting democrat anymore have it so good or are so indoctrinated they don't even think for themselves. The Democrats lost for a very complex and all-encompassing list of reasons that this thread is not going to address in any adequate measure. And it's about time. I can't believe anyone would vote for them in the first place. Well, I can, but only because I know that the people who do are literally the most out of touch with the nation. Go live in a small town in literally any state and see if people really do fit the narrative pushed by the MSM and the democrats. They don't. I've seen more hate and racism from the left this last year than I have in the entirety of my life before that, and I happen to be from a small town in west texas many would assume is full of racists.\n\n&gt;You are right though, IF Trump does a great job he will get elected again, but I don't understand your connection between that and how Democrats are acting. IF Trump is so great then the Democrats can kiss his boot and still lose because he is being such a good president so what does it matter?\n\nThe connection lies in the desire for bipartisanship. I am socially liberal, but the connection to the left ends beyond gay marriage and women's right to choose. Other than that, the democrats are frankly inefficient, stupid and hypocritical. I hope they wise up, but they won't. They are too far gone. They rigged their own primaries so badly that Hillary should have worn a nascar jacket to rallies to show who she really cares about. I guarantee it wasn't any ordinary Americans. I sincerely hope that changes because if they wise up, it can only benefit the nation. As an American, all I care about are other Americans and our nation's prosperity and safety. The democrats promised everything except those two things. \n\n&gt;However, if Trump fails then you think people will say, \"Well Trump screwed me over, but since the Democrats were mean let's vote him in again.\"\n\nThat isn't what I think. I think Trump will do a pretty good job, but if he doesn't, he deserves to lose.\n\n&gt;Let's be honest here, we know that Democrats acting this way won't hurt them with anyone who planned to vote for them anyways.\n\nEventually it will because that behavior is exactly why they lost and for anyone who wants liberalism to be a top contender again, then they will have to rebuild the party, the platform and the grass-roots organization from the ground up again. The establishment will collapse, kind of already has, and true representatives will assume the helm of the Democratic party.\n\n"}

{"parent_id":"5o7zl5","created_utc":"1484549234","author":"YNot1989","id":"dchmnqb","body":"I'd say its a preview of how he intends to look at America's alliances going forward. Trump has made it clear that he wants to radically change American foreign policy, and while it remains to be seen if he has the skill or support needed to do so, one of the keys of that change is distancing American involvement in NATO.\n\nIn rhetoric, this seems like a huge shift, but in practice its actually pretty consistent with the shifting nature of the US/Western European relationship since 2008, really since the end of the Cold War if you're inclined to make such an argument. In 2008 a reason for the alliance's being was tested in the American and European response to the Russian invasion of Georgia. European leaders largely split with America in condemning Russian action in the region. Opposition to Russian aggression in and around Europe was one of the primary reasons the alliance was founded, and in 2008 there was a clear shift in European priorities away from that opposition. Even when the threat was more clear, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Europe largely dragged their feat on sanctions due in part to economic interests in Russia, and perhaps due to the fact that there are now a few more countries between the European heartland (German, France, and the Low Countries) and Russia. Thus the US has largely leaned on the Polish-led Visegrad Group to offer a credible threat against the Russians, helped by American money, planes, training, and troops. \n\nNATO does little to benefit US interests anymore, and US foreign policy has largely come to terms with that already, Trump is just the first President to be outwardly dismissive or even hostile to the alliance. This is partly a nativist impulse to drum up support from his base (which he needs given his shaky position with Congressional Republicans), but its also to differentiate himself from the Obama Administration which outwardly looked to favor institutions like NATO, despite largely avoiding them when dealing with threats to the United States (unless they took the lead first like in Libya).\n\nThe truth is Trump's foreign policy will be, in practice, virtually identical to Obama's, much as Obama's was virtually identical to Bush's. In appearance it will be very different, antagonistic to the Europeans and Chinese, and more conciliatory to the Russians and the Turks. The US is finally discovering a new paradigm for foreign policy following the end of the first Cold War: Balance of Power. In essence its not really a new paradigm, just a new version of one used by the British during their time as the dominant power. The US is going to be a little less antagonistic to our enemies, and a little more distant to our friends all in the pursuit of playing regional powers off of eachother to limit American involvement in conflicts that are not a direct threat to the United States. This will strain relations with Europe, but the US can afford to strain relations with Europe. \n\nTrump will be hated for the perceived crises he will create, but mark my words: his successor will embrace this new paradigm in foreign policy.\n\nNOTE: I voted against Trump, don't think he's a good person or remotely qualified to lead this country, and would rather Hillary Clinton or almost anyone else be President. BUT I do think Trump may be a useful idiot with regard to America's transition to this new foreign policy paradigm. He didn't craft it, geopolitics did."}

After Beau died, Biden's heart just isn't in politics anymore. He's had 35 great and productive years in the Senate and then eight as Veep. *If* Biden does make one more attempt, I feel like it'll be the result of him being talked into it by others in the leadership to unite disparate factions. He's one of the few with the national name recognition that nearly every Dem could agree on. 2016 could've been his chance. But with Beau's death, his smiles are a little more forced, and he's been counting down the days until noon on 20 Jan 2017. Jill, Hunter and the rest of the family are there for him when he comes back home to the First State, but Beau was his soul. No parent should ever have to outlive their child - multiple times in Biden's case.\n\nAs a fellow Delawarean, I'd love nothing better to see him as President. But the man's done his time. Unless something outrageous occurs and he feels the need to step in for the good of the party, he deserves a well-earned rest.\n\nAs far as Beau goes, you know he had a bright future ahead of him. Already served as AG and in the state Nat'l Guard, and rumors had him as a popular choice for the governor's race this year. At least until he died. Were he still alive, I'd guarantee he'd have been inaugurated this week. If he wasn't running for the presidency by 2028 at the latest, I would've been shocked.\n\nBut then life steps in and everything changes. So it goes."}

The bitterness of the war led many many if not most Germans to yearn for socialism but others, war veterans who yearned for the simplicity and regular rations during war, went to the Right, and the Right had the guns and support of the well off .

The reason is fairly complex, but what it essentially boils down to is that our system is structurally, although not intentionally, biased towards a system wherein politicians coalesce into two groups.  If a politician wishes to compete and effect change, then aligning one's self to one of the two major parties is the only way to do it.  Even if one does manage to run and win as a third party or independent, they still have to effectively operate as a member of one of those parties regardless of how they were elected (e.g., Bernie Sanders is elected as an independent, but functions as any Democrat would as a member of their caucus).\n\nThird parties exist in other nations, particularly in parliamentary ones, because the system has a loophole that can favor third parties.  Most voters still coalesce into two major parties, but it's possible for third parties to siphon enough votes to prevent either major party from gaining a majority of seats.  If that happens, one or more third parties can offer to ally themselves with one of the major parties and form a coalition, which affords the third party politicians an over-sized influence compared to their actual vote share.\n\nWe would need a systematic, structural change to our republican institutions in order for third parties to become viable.  Simply allowing preferential voting won't be enough."}

As I mentioned, security underpins prosperity. Security on the continent for the last 70 years has been accomplished by binding together first the west and center, and later the south and east, into a strong alliance dedicated to collective security and cemented by American military power. The last bit is important. There have been numerous prior attempts to create a system to prevent aggression and conflict. None were guaranteed by the overarching power of an outside actor and relied on the good faith of the European powers themselves. None lasted more than a couple of decades.\n\nSo it's not about the United States acting as Europe's policeman. It's about the MEANINGFUL guarantee of collective security.\n\nThe mistake a lot of people make I think is they see the effects of the alliance (peace, prosperity, cooperation) and assume that those effects are a sort of default state that would persist if you removed their foundation, when the reality is the opposite.\n\nAnd the reason this concerns the United States is because the world is a different place than it was 150 years ago. Everything is connected. It's not even relevant to try to rank or quantify American trade with Europe as opposed to other countries. Political and economic events have ripple effects that cannot be contained. Uncertainty and conflict are bad, and reduce prosperity. Allowing the alliance to dissolve would dramatically increase the amount of uncertainty and potential for conflict in the world, and that directly impacts the prosperity and security of the United States. Our oceans can't protect us anymore."}

I actually stated in another comment that I wouldn't be surprised if we have a messy Civil War in the style of the Spanish Civil War where the war wasn't fought between different sides of the country but between the cities and the rural areas with the suburbs being caught in the middle.\n\nThe thing is I think the racial tensions are somewhat the result of the increasing cultural divide between rural and urban areas. Rural whites and urban minorities are already divided just on ethnicity. The geographical barriers that separate these two groups further limit contact and understanding. The same thing can be seen between urban whites and rural whites. There are exceptions to everything, but the trend is clear in the voting records and the polls.\n\nIf anything, this election taught us that identity politics cannot win future elections.\n\nYes, Republicans won by focusing on the white vote.\n\nYes, Republicans (mostly Trump) courted white nationalists.\n\nHowever, **the Republicans did not win the white vote by courting white nationalists.**\n\n**They won the white vote by focusing on rural issues** such as the rural decay, loss of manufacturing jobs, etc. These used to be Democratic issues and just 4-8 years before they were. Remember, a large number of Obama voters in the Midwest voted for Trump. These people are not racist. They are/were white blue-collar workers who were often unionized. White blue collar workers do tend to be socially conservative, but that's not the issue they vote on. They vote for manufacturing and Clinton woefully failed to heed to their concerns.\n\nShe kept up the identity politics strategy trying to appeal to Latinos and moderate suburbs by always pointing out how \"deplorable\" Trump was. There's nothing wrong with that, but that was literally her entire strategy. She neglected the Midwest and the rural issues and it costed the Presidency.\n\nIndeed, people are more anxious about racial relations now than in a long time, but this issue seems to be masking the real issue at hand which is the increasing fundamental political divide between rural and urban areas. Racial groups can reconcile through communication and periods of prosperity. Rural and urban areas, on the other hand, are fundamentally divided on the issues that matter most to them:\n\n* **Trade:** Cities thrive on free trade due to cheap goods and services as well as global markets for their goods and services whereas rural areas thrive on protectionism because it protects their agricultural and manufactured goods from global pricing.\n* **Borders:** Cities thrive on open borders because it allows tourism and flow of skilled workers whereas rural areas thrive on closed borders because it protects workers from low wages.\n* **Social government services:** Government services tend to be less effective in rural areas than in urban areas because rural areas are more spread out, requiring a larger investment for less people. That's why rural residents tend to be so \"anti-government\". They rarely benefit from government services besides Medicare despite paying taxes for them.\n\nThere is a divide on cultural and social grounds, but I feel these are very psychological manifestations of the real economic, geopolitical issues listed above."}

But it has long been twisted into normalized bigotry. Trump is the epitome of that. That is why Trump voters are rightfully declared bigoted. They didn't vote for solutions, they voted to \"win.\"\n\n&gt;The majority of them are concerned with their well-being and the future\n\nBut in a manner that is harmful to the other. \n\nThey are not willing to fight for fairness. They don't want a fair system. They want unfairness in their favor. They want the other to lose. Trump said \"you will be winning so much, you'll get tired of it!\" That's the highlight of his campaign. Make the others lose. \n\nThis is a major theme that's always been around in politics. The right constantly fight to keep certain factions advantaged. It is a white rich man's country. It's not new. What Trump did was dumb it down a lot and play to the idiocracy. Bigotry is a major theme every election, Trumpers are just more obvious in their bigotry. \n\n&gt; Trump is unique, and appeals to people that want to try something new.\n\nThe right has always voted for an unfair advantage. Trump is the epitome of who they want to be, they just didn't want to be so outspoken about it until now. How many conservatives do you really think wouldn't skimp out on taxes if they could get away with it? They all want to be the big powerful \"businessman.\" \n\nThe only thing unique about Trump was that he united the factions of the right. He tricked all of them into thinking he's on their side through his bigoted rhetoric. Each one of them. The poor think he's going to fight for them. The rich think he's going to help them maintain their riches. \n"}

It applies to all.  Not every company has the ability to turn a profit.  Not every company has the ability to meet customer demands.  If a company can't meet a standard, then they probably have poor management, structure, or product.  This isn't the regulations fault.\n\n&gt; Wait, so the government saying that you must comply with a standard is the market picking a winner???\n\nIf the standard applies to the entire market, and specific companies can't meet the standard...YES!!!!  Absolutely.  If a company can't meet the standard, they probably don't have the cash flow, or profit margin, to update their systems.  From a market standpoint, they are inefficient compared to their peers.  If they were a better company, they would have the ability to meet the standards, like the better companies can.  \n\nThough you are twisting my words.  I said the market chose to abandon coal.  I was specifically commenting to your statement about coal.  Simply, coal is about $4/mmbtu shipped.  Nat gas, here, is about $2.50/mmbtu delivered.  Forget the regulation.\n\nYou're a business.  What would you choose to burn.  Remember, you have to store coal in piles (that can spontaneously combust), have belts to deliver from pile to service, pulverize it, have heavy equipment for the piles and operators for equipment, etc...  Gas is a utility line coming straight into ignition.  Again, pick one.  Forget the regulations.  What's the best choice for you?\n\nEdit: a government picking winners and losers is where a company can't meet a standard so the government gives them money, or a pass from the standard, to prop them up in the name of jobs (true or false).  This happens often.  Corporate welfare is a thing and it picks winners and losers.  Creating standards to operate by doesn't, provided they are fair and apply evenly."}

Allowing unlimited contributions is basically an unlimited 401k with the ability to have any money spent out of the account on healthcare be untaxed also.

{"parent_id":"5qa5tm","created_utc":"1485488495","author":"hwqqlll","id":"dcyphz7","body":"I think that wishing for newcomers to assimilate is a normal thing, and that it can be healthy in many cases. I lived abroad in Brazil for two years, so I had to deal with this from the other end myself. I learned Portuguese, I didn't talk bad about Brazilian foods (which I honestly found kind of bland), I tried to get into soccer, and respected the fact that social customs surrounding families, time management, communities, and so on, were different from what they were in the US. I think that it's common courtesy when you go somewhere else to respect the customs and culture of that place when trying to replace it with your own. And while immigrant communities have often been better at doing this than conservatives might admit, the temptation of rejecting the culture around you and forming an ethnic enclave is always present (just as it is with American expat communities elsewhere), and denying this danger does liberals no favors.\n\nSo while I don't believe this desire to preserve culture is in itself sinister or racist, it can be twisted in racist ways. One of these ways is denying that our culture is already multicultural to a certain extent. As a white Southerner, many of the things I love \u2013 cornbread, college football, Outkast \u2013 are blacker than they are white. Another way is by using this \"cultural preservation\" idea as a way to attack people rather than a way to let them in. Look at [this article](http://theweek.com/articles/639279/bill-clintons-secret-message-whites) about Bill Clinton, specifically the third quote. It's effective because it doesn't presume that newcomers are refusing to assimilate, but it still promotes American values like work and freedom and exhorts immigrants to embrace these values instead of putting the onus on those who are already here. (I imagine the dynamic is similar in the military, which is why the military has been successful in getting people from disparate backgrounds to work together.) This, I think, is the division between the cultural nationalists who are concealed racists and those who have a healthy concern for their communities: are they saying these things with the presumption that immigrants aren't meeting them, or are they saying them in the hope that immigrants will rise up to the challenge?"}

Migraines? Stomach flu? Physical injuries? $10 to treat. No matter what my doctor does. X-rays, blood tests. It's all good. Just $10 to me and the rest to my insurance. But should I hit a telephone pole head-on at 60mph and enter a 2-week coma? My insurance will cover around $20,000 and tell me \"good luck\" with the rest. I enter bankruptcy and become clinically depressed.\n\nACA banned this plan. \n\nNow, my employer plan gives me enormous deductibles. Got a migraine? I can go to my doctor, but I'll pay him the entire retail price of the visit (hundreds of dollars). Wipe out on a bicycle? Go to urgent care. Pay retail. An outbreak of pneumonia? Hope you have hundreds of dollars to pay the doctor. Insurance won't even touch it. Then I wonder \"wait, why do I have insurance again?\" ... If I manage to have an extraordinary amount of these incidents in one year, I'll finally start getting *some* co-insurance coverage. But... if I slam into a telephone pole and nearly die and rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospital bills, my personal out of pocket will only be several thousand. I won't have to enter bankruptcy (though to some people, this in fact could still send them down that path, since the deductible is so sky high).\n\nMy other option is private insurance that I buy myself. Thanks To ACA, the only reason I'd do this is to have both worlds above. The cheap everyday visits AND the catastrophic coverage. Except, it's that second part that is monstrously expensive, so I'm looking at $400/month for coverage. Since I don't qualify for any kind of subsidy.\n\nI guess there are arguments either way, but I rather liked the peace of mind of cheap, everyday, preventative medicine instead of the forced enormous-deductible, only-worth-it-if-you-have-a-million-to-one-accident policies that Obama has force-fed through the system.

Foreign nations hold significant sums of our dollars in the form of bonds (Japan and China both hold over $1 trillion) which ties them to us. \n\nEven if/when China surpasses us in GDP (it should be mentioned that their GDP per capital lags far behind), other nations still view their economy as volatile and their future uncertain not least because they are not a democracy (and also prop up their financial indicators).\n\nDonald Trump can do much to erode that confidence in the American economy such as combatting the Fed, instituting tariffs, deregulating trading, and the like but you can expect push back from industries that keep him in check. Remember that George W Bush helped precipitate the Great Recession by pushing home ownership on families that couldn't even afford the mortgage premiums! Although Trump will inevitably hurt how the US is viewed or even initiate another recession, the US will be able to continue its leadership for generations to come as long as we can recognize our mistakes and put someone next in office willing to spend political capital to fix the mistakes of his/her predecessor (such as Obama bailing out the banks and GM).\n\nIt's important to remember what knocked off Britain, France, and Germany - WWI and WWII decimated the European continent and allowed the US - which emerged with its industry and manufacturing intact - to move into those markets and maintained its global presence from the end of the war to establish a new world order.

It is clear that Trump is sold out to Putin and that his personal interests will be put ahead of the good of the country and its citizens. What Trump's inauguration represents is a wasted opportunity to have elected a benevolent leader instead of a hate monger like Trump.  "}

This movement is gaining huge political ground largely because of the migrant crisis going on in Europe. People of European ancestry around the world are looking at the traditional homelands of Europeans being turned into colonies of non-Europeans, and they don't like it. Even Mexico has laws intended to preserve the \"character\" of their nation, and nobody bats an eye. Japan is remarkably mono-ethnic, nobody whines. Israel literally builds walls to keep their nation a Jewish ethno-state, perfectly fine.  Meanwhile, Sweden is expected to absorb millions of North Africans and like it. If anyone says anything, even the mildest objection, they get labeled a nazi and attacked. Well, the nazi label is losing its punch.

I have a friend.  He's a Brit who moved to the U.S. when he was 18.  He's a U.S. Citizen.  Very successful.  Retired now.  Worth millions.\n\nThe UK government called him one day to inform him he was still eligible for a government pension.  (I forget how much.)  Guess it's like the UK's social security.  Anyhow, he doesn't need it and hasn't lived in the UK since he was 18.  The government told him he could either have a one-time cash payment or, for $50, he could get a check every month for the rest of his life.  He took the latter and has no doubt gotten way more money than he ever paid in taxes.\n\nBut wait, it gets better.  His wife, who is American, is also eligible.  She gets the monthly check too!  She has NEVER been a UK resident.  By dint of her marriage, she gets the money.\n\nWhatever the rules are for this program, they need to be changed.  The UK is literally paying people for no reason.\n\nAs for training, there are jobs that need no training.  Sweeping the floors in a warehouse doesn't need training, it's necessary, but the labor isn't worth minimum wage.  That's the kind of job a kid could take while they are learning the shipping business.  And when it comes time to hire an entry level shipper, they'll hire the kid since he's been around the warehouse for months and at least sees how it works.  Training often comes just by being there every day and watching other people do the job.  That doesn't work for all jobs, but for many basic jobs, the sort of jobs that minimum wage is supposed to help.\n\nBy foisting a minimum wage on businesses, they cannot spend that money on a kid that sweeps up.  It's a loss.  You're asking a business to take a loss.  They're not charities.  They'll never do that.  It's like demanding that fish start breathing water."}

Should the rest of us suffer economically in order to pretend that the world is not complex and interlinked?\n\nWe don't need to manufacture everything here.

The only thing that would win you this conversation is him reversing his position and becoming indifferent to race, which he didn't. Giving non-whites in your political union equal rights (at a contentious time when doing so would help unify the state) doesn't make you not racist. The right wing is full of white nationalists who think black people should be able to vote (see: Jared Taylor). As the left is fond of pointing out, the internet is flush with racist libertarians, who are fine with equal rights for minorities within the nation so long as their number is carefully limited by immigration policy.\n\nThe point was the dude was racist AF, as was much of the west at the time. The context for this is the previous comment jumping to the \"racism == Nazism\" line. The obvious response to this is as I said: The enemies of Nazism were racist too. Maybe De Gaulle had a total reversal of opinion later in life, and would be [totally chill ](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine) with a France that was 88% black. I doubt it, and I think you doubt it too. I think you know darn well that the leaders and generation that beat the Nazis, at least at the time they did so, envisioned a white future for their countries.\n\nIf you could time-warp De Gaulle, or Churchill, or any random white person from the period and ask them \"are you indifferent to whites being a minority in 2042?\" they would almost certainly say \"no\", and quite strongly. This is the central point, one you know you can't dispute, which is why we are having this irksome side argument about a later French political compromise, as if anything you say on the incident would change the lens through which we view the West of the 1940s.\n\nThe reason this point is made at all is because the left has a strong urge to retcon historical events to be part of their grand story. People today are strongly primed to dislike the Nazis. Appropriating this dislike is useful to modern political movements, and they do so by pretending that past historical conflicts were really all about their pet issue, creating negative associations with policies they have trouble arguing against on the merits with low-info types who don't already share their values. The form this takes on the left, as we see above, is conditioning their footsoldiers to repeat banal talking points like \"having a pro-white immigration policy is a *Nazi* idea\" as if just about every nation-state of the era wasn't also defined by some ethnic/religious identity expressed in immigration policy. This rhetoric is every bit as asinine as the right's less-frequently-seen version of same, which is trying to slander single-payer healthcare or national infrastructure projects as \"Nazi ideas\", along with \"Obama is Hitler\" comparisons.\n\nThe people who opposed the Nazis, De Gaulle included, were mostly racist, and also shared those \"Nazi tenets\" with respect to immigration policy. This remains true no matter what obfuscation you can conjure up on this side business."}

They rely on a belief in intangible absolutes, which are, for all intents and purposes, religious in nature. \n\nNo. Deontological frameworks are often religious in nature, but they so not have to be, since they are concerned with rules rather than outcomes. Good examples of secular deontological ethics are honor codes (I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do) or professional codes of conduct such as the AICPA's (CPAs act with integrity, objectivity, due care, competence, etc).\n\n&gt;I'm curious about what 'pragmatic' ethics in government would entail, though. I understand their utility in examining historical action through the lens of their own time, but how do you write policy based on such a concept?\n\nPragmatic ethics can be useful for policymaking in areas where scientific advancement is expected. The viability test in *Roe v. Wade* is something akin to pragmatic ethics (28 weeks, but maybe 24 weeks in some cases is determined to be the viability pont, at which the compelling state interest in protecting life controls).\n\n&gt;I set it aside specifically to avoid derailing the conversation; bodily autonomy is a can of worms that will take over the discussion.\n\nSure. It's not actually \"bodily autonomy\" that I was trying to discuss, but rather using it as an example of where differing moral values affect ethical frameworks even within the same overall type of ethics.\n\n&gt;An appeal to our historical roots doesn't make something ethical today, though. \n\nThat's the point of this discussion - ethics are not objective, they are subjective based on underlying moral judgments and the philosophical structures that support the frameworks developed. \n\n&gt;If we are to govern in a secular manner, the only measure of a policy can be through the effects. \n\nNo. I have above rejected your assertion that deontologism is incompatible with secularism, and so your argument that only consequentialism is a valid base for a secular government is unsupported."}

The number is higher but the math is easier with 300,000.  Which averages to 451 abortions per site per year, or more than one per site per day.   \n\nNow they claim that of the 10 million activities they do per year, [34%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/12/for-planned-parenthood-abortion-stats-3-percent-and-94-percent-are-both-misleading/?utm_term=.fbb3866a72d9) are contraceptive related (ranging from full prescription for birth control to renewal of script to handing out a single condom to one person).   But still, average is higher than one per site per day.\n\n&gt;If you had a separate building (extra rent and utilities) with a redundant staff (someone has to work at the abortions only facility) redundant equipment (they need tools to work) you have just bloated PP's operating costs and whatever money might be received for abortion services would not be able to sustain the operating costs.\n\nYou literally just argued that federal money goes to abortions.

And then by sqrt(4*(4-1)). And you go out as far as you might possibly need for each state. (This is called the Method of Equal Proportions.)\n\n* So, 50 seats have already been allocated. Who gets the 51st seat? Well, it's whichever state has the highest of those calculated numbers above; for this seat, which state has the highest result when you divide their population by sqrt(2*(2-1)), using 2 because you're allocating a state's second seat.\n\n* Who gets the 52nd seat? Whichever state has the highest result when you divide their population by sqrt(n*(n-1)), where n is one more than however many seats that state \"already\" has.\n\n* After you've allocated the 435th seat, you're done.\n\nIt would be weird to try to figure out exactly \"why\" a state might gain a seat after you re-allocate when adding another state. You'd kind of have to just go through all the calculations one at a time to see \"where\" the change happened. Part of it would have to do with the change in the population of the \"average\" seat across the country: 435 divided by the population of the 50 states is different from 435 divided by the population of 51 or 52 states when you add PR and/or DC."}

These tackle the root of the problem, by trying to reduce current discrimination in the government. Even if you do manage to push through reparations, if you don't do this, you've accomplished nothing.\n\nReparations though, they don't really do much in that regard. The case for reparations isn't particularly solid anyway- we as a society don't believe in punishing the child for the sins of the parent, and that's what it *will* be seen as. You'll have to explain to a group of people who have never done anything particularly discriminatory themselves why they owe a different part of society something. \"Because the great great grandparents of someone who looks like you took advantage of the great great grandparents of someone who look's like them back in the day, and as a result they've been at a big disadvantage ever since\" isn't going to cut it.\n\nBut even if you get past that huge \"hell no\" you'll get and pass it anyway, you won't do much. You give a certain class a temporary econic boost at the expense of other classes. But then the attitude of everyone else is \"okay, problem solved\". But the policies that still keep people down still exist, and sooner or later, you're going to hear more calls for the real reforms that are needed.

I went into 2016 thinking the right was falling apart but now after the election it really looks like it's the left that is divided.\n\nI don't see any way to reconcile moderates/progressives and \"progressives\" at this point because there are no defined ways forward.\n\n\"progressives\" have drawn a hard line saying that everyone who voted Trump doesn't just disagree with them, they took a deliberate malicious action based entirely on racist/fascist ideals. Anyone who disagrees is labelled a racist.\n\nThe problem here is there doesn't seem to be any outcome that will actually satisfy this base. If you claim that you're not racist/fascist, you are, and if you admit that you have prejudices that you're trying to deal with, you're still a racist/fascist. There's no forward motion no where do we go now? It's all just this angry self-pity or whatever because it's not about actually solving the problem, it's about having a reason to actively dehumanize the outgroup. Yes the right started the practice, but the left is starting to follow suit.\n\nThere's been a complete refusal to entertain anything but this mindset and as someone who believes that hatred of immigrants/minorities is more of a social disease that requires treatment which can be accomplished through the democratic party I've already established myself as too moderate for the radical left which doesn't really seem to have any views on the matter beyond \"everyone who voted Trump is racist and therefore terrible and undeserving of anything beyond the slow painful decline into poverty that awaits them\"\n\nHonestly the only way forward is for the more moderate progressives to cut off the more extreme faction, and then rally the moderates behind them. It's a lot easier to sell change to the majority when you get rid of the toxic minority that's going to torpedo any attempts to do so because it's either not enough or requires reaching out to the vanishing middle class including in the Rust Belt and places that went Trump, which is tantamount to treason."}

A hospital cannot make up any price it wants if 90% of healthcare dollars are paid by a single entity.  Ditto anyone else.  \n\nNow, one classic macroeconomic failure when you force prices down - essentially set a price ceiling - is a shortage.\n\nThis is where the \"death panels\" and the waiting lists come in.  With a healthcare system that always has a shortage of actual care available (since at the price it is willing to pay, there are a finite number of doctors and hospitals) versus care demanded, you have to deny expensive, futile care to those who will probably die anyway and you have to make people wait in line for marginally useful, nonessential care.  (like back surgery)\n\nCan't have one without the other.  The way it works now, there is still a shortage in that not everyone gets what they need, nor is there actually enough medicine or doctors for everyone, but instead it's a bidding war, and those who can pay the most get all the care they want and then some, while those who cannot pay enough get nothing."}
