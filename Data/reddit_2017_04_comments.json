Will humans *eventually* find other jobs to do? Sure. \n\nBut the last time we had an industrial revolution was well over 100 years ago. Times were dramatically different. There were absolutely no labor laws, no social safety net, no social protections, absolutely nothing of that nature that was significant. So when the industrial revolution hit them; it hit an American workforce that was extremely adaptable and flexible. Is that the case today? Absolutely not.\n\nThe vast majority of people who remember the Great Depression (and even WWII) have passed away. And even in that era we had a good amount of social protections that were being created during FDR's New Deal. We have generations of people, starting with baby boomers-onwards, who have grown up in a far, far more comfortable environment with all of the social safety protections and a fairly stable Keynesian/monetarist business cycle economy than did the Americans who were alive for the last industrial revolution. Post WWII generations have grown up expecting a decent standard of living and a decent job. The American workforce today are not even 1/10 as flexible as the American workforce was during the last industrial revolution. \n\nI can't imagine that the Republican Party can provide solutions to these problems with the same ole' 40 year neoliberalism philosophy. They're gonna keep pursuing policies that dismantle social protections and the safety net and tell people to just \"be more flexible\" like they did in 1980. They'll harken back to Reagan to no avail. It'll be like Jimmy Carter and the Democrats trying to remind voters of the New Deal in the midst of stagflation. Interestingly enough the economic and political conditions of the world look strikingly opposite to that of the late 70's. "}

I'm not sure what the answer is besides reducing gerrymandering and going from there, but things will not continue this way. One thing to keep in mind is the growing liberal leaning youth. This demographic shift was never going to ensure the Democratic majorities people once had assumed was the new political reality, but the fact remains that as the youth grows in proportion of the electorate and starts becoming more a factor in elections, this will create a shift that no one will account for. The 2016 election is a snapshot in time, its how a small portion of America felt for (mostly) a single day. The future is uncertain, and that is doubly true for politics. For me that means theres mostly upside. This country elected Obama twice. Then it elected Trump. One step back, two step forwards. History isn't a straight line of progress. Trump is the last gasp of holding onto the past before the future takes hold. Progress moves forward even now.

They are capitalist countries with considerable amounts of welfare.\n\n&gt;The idea of lean Nordic government will come as a shock both to French leftists who dream of socialist Scandinavia and to American conservatives who fear that Barack Obama is bent on \u201cSwedenisation\u201d. They are out of date. In the 1970s and 1980s the Nordics were indeed tax-and-spend countries. Sweden\u2019s public spending reached 67% of GDP in 1993. Astrid Lindgren, the inventor of Pippi Longstocking, was forced to pay more than 100% of her income in taxes. But tax-and-spend did not work: Sweden fell from being the fourth-richest country in the world in 1970 to the 14th in 1993.  \n\n&gt;Since then the Nordics have changed course\u2014mainly to the right. Government\u2019s share of GDP in Sweden, which has dropped by around 18 percentage points, is lower than France\u2019s and could soon be lower than Britain\u2019s. Taxes have been cut: the corporate rate is 22%, far lower than America\u2019s. The Nordics have focused on balancing the books. While Mr Obama and Congress dither over entitlement reform, Sweden has reformed its pension system (see Free exchange). Its budget deficit is 0.3% of GDP; America\u2019s is 7%.  \n\n&gt;On public services the Nordics have been similarly pragmatic. So long as public services work, they do not mind who provides them. Denmark and Norway allow private firms to run public hospitals. Sweden has a universal system of school vouchers, with private for-profit schools competing with public schools. Denmark also has vouchers\u2014but ones that you can top up. When it comes to choice, Milton Friedman would be more at home in Stockholm than in Washington, DC.  \n\nhttp://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21571136-politicians-both-right-and-left-could-learn-nordic-countries-next-supermodel\n\n\n&gt;The path to socialism too often gets stalled at the takeover stage [...]  Countries that move past that centralization of power and go on to true redistribution\n\nHow can the government have the power to redistribute resources without being able to abuse that power?

It was heavily regulated and tons of info was required to be included.  Sometime in the mid 90s, the FDA finally revisited the regulations as technology had changed.  They eased regulations on the required info in the ad itself and allowed the ad to refer listeners to websites or 800 numbers for this information, for example.  \n\nThe issue with Oxycontin, as far as I can see, is unrelated.  [Here is a synopsis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622774/) of a more academic paper that is on the national institutes of health website.  \n\nAccording to that, Oxycontin marketing did not take place on TV or direct to consumer at all - or at least, primarily.  It was a massive push by the manufacturer at marketing to physicians via symposiums and conferences and visits from drug reps.  They invested in a database to identify which physicians prescribed the most pain medications and put special emphasis on those physicians.  \n\nThe company's rationale was that let them id the parts of the country containing the most pain sufferers.  From a certain high level look this made sense.  Most of these physicians were concentrated in places like KY, AL, or WVA where a lot of people work in mining or manufacturing.  \n\nThe problem with this method is that it isn't really weeding out physicians prescribing it more often because they were just lax about it.  \n\nIn addition, the company heavily pushed it's low risk for addiction.  While they had a couple of studies that backed up this claim, ithey didn't really distinguish between using it to treat acute pain vs chronic pain and how longer term use for chronic pain might be different.   Then they heavily marketed it to physicians for chronic pain too.  \n\nI can't see where Bill Clinton was involved in any of this and it seems particularly contorted to use it to slur Hillary Clinton.  YMMV."}

Bellotti\nDoes the First Amendment protect the rights of corporations to attempt to influence the outcome of elections in which they have no direct monetary interest?\nYes. Justice Lewis F. Powell delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the right to attempt to influence the outcomes of elections is one of the primary rights the First Amendment was meant to protect. If this form of speech came from a person rather than a corporation, there would be no question about whether it was protected speech. The Court also held that its previous decisions regarding the First Amendment rights of corporations emphasized the role that such speech played in creating public discussion.\nIn his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that the Massachusetts risked stifling the speech of organizations who use the corporate form to ensure mass communication with the public. He also argued that the statute could easily interfere with the First Amendment protection of the freedom of speech, since many newspapers and other news sources are part of large media conglomerations.\nhttps://www.oyez.org/cases/1977/76-1172\nThis appears to work the other way than what you describe - freedom of the press is understood to apply to individuals, and the Burger Court decided that operating as a corporation doesn't change that.\n\nAlthough the majority echoed many of the arguments in\u00a0First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, Stevens argued that the majority opinion contradicted the reasoning of other campaign finance cases \u2013 in particular,\u00a0Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce\u00a0and\u00a0McConnell v. Federal Election Commission\u00a0\u2013 and found it telling that the majority, when citing such cases, referenced mainly dissenting opinions. (From minority opinion in case)"}

I think if anything is going to displace oil it's not going to be something that currently supplies 1 to 2% of total energy. Plus most of the issues with nuclear plants are either mass hysteria or are being solved (like the waste issue).\n\nGay marriage - Support it. Republicans need to get over it already.\n\nAbortion - Pro-Choice, for the most part. Personally, I don't like the idea of abortion but I have no right to impose my views on others. Also if it was illegal it'd just mean back alley abortions and more parent-less children. \n\nSupreme Court - What McConnell did was stupid. It was Obama's pick. Merrick by all notions was pretty tame and it was a huge gamble. That said, I'm happy with Gorsuch cause I like originalism (mostly). Kinda shitty for me to say, but sorry. Democrats aren't unjustified in anger but I really want them to move past it otherwise bipartisanship is fucked for a decade or two.\n\nTaxes - Cut them across the board.\n\nSpending - Reduce it. Address Social Security and Medicare first.\n\nHealthcare - I don't like the idea of universal coverage by the government. I think Obamacare was a failure. I REALLY wanted to try out Rand Paul's ideas in his reform bill, just to see where things go.\nThat said, if the private sector can't end up fixing things then fuck it. Universal coverage we go in another decade or two.\n\nDrugs - Make weed legal. Decriminalize the rest, like Portugal. Drugs needs to be a health issue first, criminal second. Arrest violent dealers and producers, not guys selling on the sidewalk or smoking at home. \n\nCriminal justice reform - Mandatory minimums are stupid.\n\nAnything else?"}

Additional SmartBoards/iPads/whatever aren't strictly necessary, we've been teaching without them for generations. \n\nWe should be paying teachers more. Given the same salary, why should teachers work in a city school? Living in the suburbs is more relaxed, and the kids are easier to deal with. Teaching in a city school is a harder job, and deserves a higher pay than teaching elsewhere. Anyone can teach in a high school in a nice middle-upper class area. I'm a college student, and I can confidently say that I could manage to teach some classes at my high school. It's a job that could easily be done by someone fresh out of college with an education degree. Working in a city school requires more experience, and that's exactly what a higher salary should attract. Experienced teachers need an incentive to leave the suburbs and work in the city. \n\nAfter school programs should receive more funding. We need more sports, more arts, and more opportunities for more technology training to keep inner-city kids off the streets and further their development at the same time, and there's no better solution than quality after school programs. We need schools that can offer city kids the same opportunities that upper-middle class suburban parents can offer their kids privately. Suburban families have opportunities to take their kids to soccer practice, ballet lessons, piano lessons, summer sleep-away camp, etc., and these have a huge impact on a kid's development. City families often don't have this. \n\nHonestly, I think after school programs are perhaps the best way to tackle issues in urban education. If kids don't have a home environment that fosters a good attitude towards personal growth and development, then our education system should step up and provide one. City schools will always proportionally require more resources than schools elsewhere, and if you want to tackle the cost issue directly, you have to look at the broken justice system that creates these circumstances.

Would the drug war have ended under Clinton? No. But she wouldn't have promoted someone who thinks weed is equivalent to heroin as her attorney general, ending any chance marijuana becomes legal under federal law or by executive order or any which way. Right now it's a states issue, and certain states accept it, and under Clinton that may have continued, but her disdain wouldn't have been a front and center issue.\n\n2. The minimum wage was something Clinton talked about needing an increase. Was it $15? Nope. But Trump and the republicans will laugh in your face about raising the minimum wage by $.01.\n\n3. Healthcare as we know under republican control has already been a joke with their proposed bill and will always be a joke, and they are not going to pass it unless it makes rich people save more money.\n\nIf you think that the way we are headed under Trump wouldn't have been that much different from Clinton, then...idk, i'd be confused."}

Should nine unelected judges be responsible for altering/making policy every time the law leads to a shitty outcome? Apparently that's what Gorsuch's critics expect him to have done in this case.\n\nHere's the thing, the law doesn't state such a position. Gorsuch crafted a novel interpretation (what people often call legislating from the Bench) that said that he could be fired for operating equipment to save his own life. That language never appears in the statute, in fact the statue says that preservation of life must be the first consideration in that it provides for a protection from termination in cases where operating equipment is dangerous to human life.\n\nIt's pretty clear that the statute intends that companies can't direct employees to risk their lives under the duress of losing their job.  Furthermore, the single most important principle under-girding all law, and is the basis for common law, is the natural law of self-preservation. \n\nIn common law, for example, the doctrine of necessity may be used possible justification or an exculpation for breaking the law. Defendants seeking to rely on this defense argue that they should not be held liable for their actions as a crime or tort because their conduct was necessary to prevent some greater harm and when that conduct is not excused under some other more specific provision of law such as self defense. \n\nSo Gorsuch's decision was so awful in pretty much every way and is the opposite of the type of law we want from a Supreme Court Justice. That's why, by the way, he was in the minority in the decision and NO OTHER JUDGE who saw the case agreed with his insane and evil interpretation.\n"}

It's the only thing that I could legitimately see causing a world war through a somewhat plausible sequence of events (if both Trump and Putin enjoy brinkmanship and madman at the wheel theory).

My perspective is all very anecdotal, but I think trying to sway WV to vote democrat is a waste of time.\n\nWest Virginians used to pride themselves on their independence, but these days you'll see Confederate flags everywhere. WV was never a Confederate state. The fracking industry is actively destroying the land in my area: the water is polluted, and the land is cluttered with ugly factories. As far as I can tell, the majority of the fracking jobs are going to people from out of state, and West Virginians' main stake in the process is selling their land off to be raped and pillaged. I haven't met anyone with an opioid addiction, but it doesn't at all surprise me that it runs rampant in WV. Disability appears to be a way of life here, and opioids probably seem like the only escape for many.\n\nThere's no pride, no forward thinking, no hope. If West Virginians had such things, they'd see that Republicans are only taking advantage of them. As it is, WV is a fast sinking ship with its crew and passengers hastily adding buckets of water."}

It was the misuse of funds that brought him down. Now you can add that to the fall of the former Speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives and you have something to hold on to if it wasn't for a small problem. It was Republican Party members both in the House and within the executive branch of government that have lead the charge against both people. It will be extremely hard for Democratic challengers to connect Governor Ivey to either one of those scandals and even if they can they run the risks of Democratic skeletons in the closet reaching out to give them the touch of death. Any connection to Don Singleman or Larry Langford would be political poison to any Democratic candidate.  \n\nThe current state of the Alabama Democratic Party is not good. Most of their rising stars some 15 years ago are now Republicans and that includes the new Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey btw. There has been massive defections of Democrats to the Republicans over the last 15 years. What is driving these defections? Well its the continued move to the left by the DNC that is making this so. Ever since Nancy Pelosi became the poster child of everything wrong with the Democratic Party the Alabama Democrats have been curb stomped to a point that they only hold 8 of 35 Alabama State Senators, 33 of 105 Alabama Representatives, 0 Executive Branch offices (first time in Alabama's history btw), and one U.S. House of Representative in Terri Sewell. Due to this domination there are not that many well known Democrats that could win a state wide election. The Alabama Democrats need help from the national leadership but unfortunately for them the national Democrats are holding firm to the leaders that have driven Alabama Democrats into exile within the Republican Party. You Democrats want to challenge in Alabama then select leaders that Alabama voters can relate to and not have a raving lunatic as the face of your Party. "}

Create a greater appearance of legitimacy than anything done unilaterally.\n\n3. Cost: spread the burden.\n\n4. A possibility for checks and balances in the system.\n\nIt's not necessary to do this through the UN or with Russia's approval.  Even if the USA + EU + Australia + New Zealand act together that's already better than just the USA doing it.  If Brazil, Argentina, China, India and Japan can also be included, even better.  The problem with Russia is that they are in some ways a USA-wannabe.  Here we are trying to reduce how unilaterally the USA acts, but Russia would only want to do that with the motivation of itself acting one day unilaterally.  At least the present Russia under Putin I think is like that.  I don't trust Putin and I also don't like his vision of Russia.  I think what Putin envisions is disgusting and horrible.  So if this coalition has to work without Russia, I say fuck em at least for now.  When Russia starts respecting independent journalism, dissent, and democracy, let's talk about it again then.  Until then, who cares what Russia wants?  That still doesn't mean the USA should act unilaterally anyway."}

Also, the tax cuts promised by the GOP are, as usual, intended for the wealthy and not for lower/middle-income Americans, so it's hard to see if it'll really be popular. Then again, like you said, Americans love tax cuts, so it could be spun as a positive. \n\n* ACA: Symbolic repeal isn't good enough for the hard right. They want the whole thing gone. Moderates want reform. It's hard to reconcile their disparate wants while being popular.\n\n* Dodd-Frank: Most Americans don't know or care about this specific bill. The GOP could repeal it, but who would care? And arguably, Dodd-Frank didn't go far enough to prevent another recession.\n\n* North Korea: The idea that Donald Trump, of all people, could have emotional restraint and de-escalate the situation in the peninsula, is laughable. After the Syria bombing, he said he did it because he got sad when seeing children get gassed on TV. That's the sign of someone who acts on emotion, not reason. He's likely to just make it worse. \n\nBUT, if Trump can somehow cleanly eliminate the NK threat via diplomacy, then he deserves a second term honestly. \n\nOTOH, if he gets into a war, then it'll be horrific. And seeing US troops coming back home in body bags from an unnecessary war may cause him to lose re-election."}

{"parent_id":"dgjatv3","created_utc":"1492783914","author":"CodeUmbra","id":"dgk7kk2","body":"Again, communication is key here. I'm not suggesting that we make our legislature follow computers blindly based off of general inferred information (infermation, if you will), but use that as a baseline to start a meaningful discussion with their constituency. For example, if you, a politician representing a rich/poor split constituency, where only the rich can afford to attend town hall meetings, then you'll much more likely get a skewed view of what you should be doing. Algorithms can help you realise what __may__ be happening, which you can investigate into. Without them, you may not even realise that a good portion of your constituency is suffering.\n\nOn the same token, the people can hold you much more accountable when they know you have the tools to see if your constituency is suffering. It's all about the *communication*. Obviously, a real constituent's voice takes precedence over a computer, but realistically speaking, not EVERY constituent can have their voice heard ALL of the time. It's much better than what out-of-touch politicnas currently do: take a huge gamble, fail, and break the poor more and more, opening the door to corruption.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it's far more effective at helping you understand underlying themes within a community. In addition, with gerrymandering, it can help fairly group your constituents together to let local laws fit a particular constituency more fairly.\n\nAnd even if this approach doesn't appeal to you, algorithms are still incredibly powerful in just __proving__ things like gerrymandering to the courts. As I've noted, in the link earlier, the algorithms are not used to merely force laws on unwilling constituents, but to figure out more about them (and about the politicians that draw those borders) to determine whether a politician is overstepping their boundaries.\n\nEDIT: Machine-only vs. human-only is a huge topic of discussion in Computer Science. The most common and agreed approach is human-machine cooperation, which is my entire point. "}

Problem is that neither of those are problems in our current economy. The problems we have going forward are partly the direct result of the 2008 crisis (deregulating finance since the 80's) combined with the side effects of that crisis.\n\nPeople's personal balance sheets are bloated from the credit they took on in the early 2000's and the working class of this country are struggling to pay it back. There's no real wage increases to help them and only a tiny bit of controlled inflation which doesn't help to ease the burden of the debt. Since they can't pay it back, creditors fight harder to get their money back and this becomes a vicious cycle in it of itself. This isn't sustainable. \n\nI don't see how an economic paradigm that would further deregulate our financial markets and was created to reduce the high inflation of the late 70's by disciplining labor would increase real wages or deal with any of the economic woes people face today.

Trump is used to pushing people around, and making threats. That is obviously effective in his previous line of work. But it's not effective in government. He has no real leverage over congress, and doesn't seem to understand how it works, or what their pressure points even are. He's exposed his own ignorance, and he has exposed that he only has one real game plan when it comes to negotiation, and that game plan is not going to work when dealing with congress. It also likely won't work when trying to negotiate with other nations on things like trade deals.\n\nAnd my great fear is that he's using the exact same playbook with North Korea. Bluster and threats only work if you are willing to follow through on them. With what is going on in North Korea right now, he's put us in a situation where the path to \"victory\" is incredibly narrow. If they follow through on his provocation, and test a nuke, he's likely to back down, and fuck our ability to deal with them completely. Or he's going to follow through, and start a war with a country that can effectively wipe a massive city (Seoul) off the map. His only shot at \"success\" in this is NK backing down in the face of Trump's provocations, and if they are following domestic US politics at all, I fear that they would decide to test him. "}

However, I think there may be room for another option that's as simplistic as it is idealistic (read: ain't gonna happen). But, here's the one quality that's missing in our government that I think would make it instantly better overnight.\n\nLeadership.  Specifically, leadership with a goal toward unification.\n\nWhatever \"leadership\" has or hasn't been shown lately has fueled the party politics game.  We've had great leadership in order to keep the status quo and great leadership to rally against people who disagree with certain individuals.  What we need now is leadership to force people to work together.\n\nPersonally, while I tend to think that the office of the President of the United States is much weaker than most people in the US seem to (intentionally limited by the framers of the US Constitution), I also think any president could immediately improve political relations in this country by telling Congress that he will veto every bill that comes across his desk without a supermajority (288 yea votes in the house, 67 in the senate).\n\nWhat does that mean for our current political climate?  Well, party favoritism from the executive branch?  Gone.  Filibuster rules in the senate?  Gone.  Whip counts?  Largely superfluous when you need the majority and minority whips to work together to ensure 66.6%.\n\nCongress would have a choice.  Do nothing (or effectively nothing by passing bills that don't matter), do something good (start working together for the good of a lot of people that both sides of the aisle could get behind), or do something bad (start working together for the good of congress and not for the American people... lining their own pockets in the future, etc.).\n\nEventually the president could raise his foot off the brake and start actually governing, but the threat would still be there and hopefully a new spirit of cooperation as congress's approval rating raises above 11% for once.\n\nBut I think any idea like this represents halcyon days gone by more than it does reality."}

There's no point in the Republicans just dropping social stances entirely and solely advocating for lower taxes and spending because no one would vote for that outside of affluent suburbs; most minorities probably wouldn't want to vote for the party advocating alleviating poverty less, even if they didn't think they hated them. Similarly, there's no point to the Democrats in keeping their hard line on immigration and guns since that does nothing but drop the midwest and south. The affluent simply aren't enough to win an election; the only reason they're winning now is because circumstances have it so that each half of the poor think a different half of the affluent are out to get them enough to ally with the other half of the affluent.\n\nThe current organization of American politics is an anomaly; the country's destined to have a nationalist/socialist coalition and a liberal coalition.

Our allies in Europe and the Gulf have expressed support for our actions as well as Turkey and Israel.\n\nBut let's be clear about what happens next. We were not under direct attack, and our decision to engage in unilateral military action means that we are far more likely to engage in further escalation in the Syrian Civil War. If Assad is removed from power, we will have to engage in diplomacy and nation-building to ensure that a power vacuum does not arise which could draw even more states in the region into chaos and lawlessness. That would mean a lengthy American involvement in yet another Middle Eastern country, and it's not clear there is a public appetite for this.\n\nOne thing is for certain, and that is the isolationist hands-off approach that Donald Trump advocated on the campaign trail is over. Like other presidents before him, he has had to respond to situations beyond his control and commit our nation to a course of action he considers necessary. For that, I commend the president - use of chemical weapons are war crimes that cannot be tolerated. My thoughts and prayers are for the Syrian people and for the continued guidance for our president as our country embarks on another chapter down War's grim road."}

I despised the Republicans after the recession, when years of their failed economic policies decimated the economy of my hometown. Everything Republicans did pushed me farther away from them, and I voted Democrat ever since I could vote.\n\nBut I identify as an independent. After getting my polisci degree, I went to go work on Capitol Hill. Naively, I thought the Democrats were going to be the party of sanity, of community and working together and peace and love and a genuine interest in the betterment of the country and its people. I was wrong; Democrats were politicians just like the Republicans. They hated and conspired against people who didn't perfectly align with their beliefs, cut out any dissenters and turned on those who didn't play the game. They were corrupt; the congresswoman I worked for paid the local police department to arrest, detain, and release her as part of a publicity stunt at a protest. She paid nothing to the department to have the other protesters released. They were blind; the longer I worked on the hill, the more I saw that the Republicans also cared about the wellbeing and betterment of the country and its people, just in a different way. The Democrats I worked with refused to see that, and only saw the Republicans as the enemy.\n\nSo I left the world of politics, stopped going to protests, stopped knocking on doors, stopped making phone calls, stopped volunteering in campaigns, and stopped paying much attention. Ideologically, I still identify more closely with the Democrats' platform. Yet I will never identify as a Democrat again; I was soured off of party identification for the rest of my life by the experiences I went through and the disgust I felt."}

Trump ran a platform that included both of these ideas, although he's since gone back on them. You may not be an isolationist of this stripe, but they certainly do exist.\n\nBut for those whose isolationism is a little more limited--I'm not arguing that there isn't some room to pull back, because there certainly is, but these people seem a little ignorant of how interconnected geopolitical regions/scenarios/crises/influence tend to be. If you choose not to act, you're causing a whole cascade of other actions across the entire region. The U.S.'s decision not to intervene earlier in the Rwandan genocide did not just lead to the deaths of millions of Rwandans, it also led to a massive refugee crisis which spilled over into the borders of neighboring countries like Uganda and the DRC. Those countries then descended into civil wars/conflicts that are still, in some cases, ongoing to this day, involving child soldiers and child slavery and a massive rape-as-a-weapon-of-war crisis (which in turn led to spiking HIV/AIDS rates). It's now more than two decades after the genocide, and the entire region remains massively underdeveloped economically, because the conflicts ensured that resources could not be tapped and economic developments could not be put into place.\n\nNow, would the U.S.'s earlier involvement in Rwanda have magically prevented all these problems? Not at all, but it's hard to envision it could have made them worse. What happened without our intervention is already about as bad as it's possible to get. I think there's an assumption that some isolationists make based on a facile understanding of geopolitics that the U.S.'s involvement is what's causing the problems there. But when you actually look at the issues these countries were facing before U.S. involvement, in most cases they were heading to the exact same spot regardless of U.S. intervention or not.

[(Source)](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster) These give a good read of the country to some extent but many people will badmouth the national parties while approving of their own congressman/senator.\n\nIt's not exactly apples to apples to compare favorables to job approval but Trump [is sitting at about -11 as well in the aggregate of his job approval.](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster)\n\nI would be careful about reading too much into party favorable rating as well. In late 2013, the GOP hit -40 (!) net favorables in the wake of the shutdown...and then went on to sweep in the midterms less than a year later. \n\n&gt; I think people are greatly overestimating the likelihood of this. \n\nAll that said, I still agree with you. People seem to assume the house flipping as a given- conditions look good now but so much can change until November 2018."}

This is why their policies actually boost abortions in the real world: because what actually works to reduce abortions contravenes their worldview.  Understanding and accepting the facts and logic behind this would necessitate rejecting their core belief system.  \n\nIn other words, they will retain an obviously fallacious model and flawed approach to an issue if doing so is more coherent with their deep-seated religious beliefs.\n\nedit: you can also understand this as an [Omelas](http://engl210-deykute.wikispaces.umb.edu/file/view/omelas.pdf) issue: stopping the fight against the abortion of one baby in order to save 999,999 babies would be to accept a society which allows for the cruel murder of one baby, which is unacceptable.  It would be unspeakable for anyone to accept that society at all regardless of how many or few babies are murdered.\n\nThe problem with this is that you'd expect people to start doing a halfway decent job of saving the lives of babies while still fighting for the ones they can't save.

The first use of the filibuster wasn't until 1837.\n\nOver time we've created a use for this procedural quirk of history, but it's not some intentional check. It wasn't even part of the original Senate rules, and wasn't used until nearly 50 years after the the modern federal US government was formed.\n\nIf we're talking about \"intent\", the original rules of the Senate didn't allow for a filibuster, so if anything the current filibuster is abusing a procedural trick that shouldn't have existed."}

Well, then we'd definitely have 6 years of Trump instead of the possibility of only 4 years if he screws up.  You tell me if that's a good idea.\n\nIMHO, the perfect term structure is the one we have now.  4 years is long enough for the president to adapt to his job, but not long enough for him to do too much damage if he is bad.  Allowing a president to win a second 4 year term let's the country retain talent in the office while also acting as a check on his power by forcing the president to win votes for a second time.  \n\nTerm limiting the presidency after 8 years is a good idea for such a powerful position because it prevents centralization of power.  I'm OK with no or very long term limits on congressmen because they share their power with hundreds of other legislators who can check their power, which makes centralization of power harder.

If anything it's relatively benign compared to some of the worst examples of US intervention in ostensibly democratic processes during the height of the Cold War. \n\nWhat does make this unique, especially in the post-Cold War era, is two things: \n\n1. The fact that it occurred between two \"great powers\" and security council members. Interventions like this, while common against smaller nations in imperial/cold war contests, have not really been carried out by great powers against others. Low-level espionage is par for the course, but support for destabilizing forces and targeted espionage of their political opponents is (someone correct me) pretty new to be happening between Great Powers since the end of WWII. \n\n2. The overt manner (blatant? brash?) of the attack on the US. Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the US made concerted efforts to avoid direct confrontation. Proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, even in Syria today, never grew into direct military confrontation by design, because of the risks of open war between nuclear powers. While we've struggled to define where on the spectrum of \"attacks\" hacking for the purposes of delegitimizing media coverage falls, it's far closer to open conflict than any other espionage that's happened recently. \n\n&gt;shouldn't there be a degree of self-scrutiny when we point out Russia's interference\n\nI'm confused what type of self scrutiny you mean? Like, should the US be saying, \"well we've done this to other people in the past and it feels bad now so we should stop being mad?\" I think that expectation is unrealistic, no more than it is naive to think the Soviet Union learning during it's dissolution that institutional instability is bad and they should stop promoting it elsewhere. Attacks like this, whether military or not, tend to breed defensiveness, anger, and greater resolve to better defense and reciprocal intervention in the future. \n\nSo, can nations like Iran, Chile, and other snicker as the US complains about election interference and violations of democratic rights? Of course they can. Should the US reconsider their own influence in destabilizing other nations? Yes, and I'd argue they're thinking did shift from the early Cold War, to the late Cold War, and again in the Unipolarity after the USSR's collapse (which decayed and then was reinforced by the Iraq debacle). But, should we expect the primary narrative coming out of the US in the wake of an attack on democratic institutions to be a critical re-evaluation of its own role in other coup d'etats? Probably not. \n\n**TL;DR: It's not that different, but it is different because of the nations involved, and the most likely response in this situation is not \"are we the baddies?\" but instead \"Fuck Russia\"**"}

Over time, [the parties have drifted apart, with the Republicans veering particularly sharply](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2014/06/no_name-1/38e2d0919.jpg).\n\nBut it's also very easy to see as a watcher of politics.  For example:\n\n* Do you agree that during the Obama years, the GOP moved rightward because of the Tea Party, and consciously worked to excommunicate politicians they saw as too likely to compromise with Obama?  If yes, don't you think that results in a far more conservative party?\n\n* Look what has happened to the term \"RINO.\"  This is a bit anecdotal, but [here](http://humanevents.com/2005/12/27/top-10-rinos-republicans-in-name-only/) is an article from a conservative website in 2005 listing \"RINOs\" - people like Lincoln Chafee, Olympia Snow, Arlen Specter, Susan Collins - all certainly Republicans that I would agree are in the very moderate wing of the party.  Look at, for example, [this list today](https://www.conservativereview.com/top-25-rinos) - John McCain?  He was the party's nominee in 2008!  Paul Ryan was [trumpeted not that long ago](http://www.teapartyexpress.org/5047/congressman-paul-ryan-strong-tea-party-choice-for-vice-president) for being a great hero of the Tea Party wing - now he's a RINO???  (I have seen him called a RINO repeatedly in conservative subreddits of late as well).\n\n* We used to all have our quibbles with the media, but both parties generally agreed that major newspapers and network news reported well-sourced facts that were rigorously reported.  One party has basically stood still on that count, and it's not the Republicans.  And I don't think it's because major newspapers and network news have dramatically changed their ideology over time.\n\n* Think about how easy it is to find members of former GOP adminitrations that say the party has left them?  *Edit* One of the authors of this paper, Norm Ornstein, somewhat falls into this category, as he is a resident at AEI (although I think he considers himself a centrist rather than a true conservative).\n\n* Watch the upcoming budget negotiations - it used to be the case that both parties would see a clean continuing resolution as the worst thing they would possibly agree to.  But we may have a government shutdown now because the Republicans internally refuse to settle for even that.\n\nIt's certainly the case that the left has moved pretty far left on identity issues over the last 10 years or so.  But I think that pales in comparison to the systematic rejection within the GOP of any area of bipartisan factual or procedural agreement in fear that it would lead their representatives to enter into compromises with the dreaded Obama."}

The idea was that the embryo was immobile and therefore more like a vegetable in both physical and spiritual state, and that the soul was an animating force. It is one of many competing views on ensoulment that has influenced Christianity, though there has been support for laws against abortion independent of whether life begins at conception. [according to Wikipedia]\n\n&gt; Some medieval Christian theologians, such as Marsilio Ficino, held that ensoulment occurs when an infant takes its first breath of air. They cite, among other passages, Genesis 2:7, which reads: \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\"[13]\n\n&gt; The Early Church held various views on the subject, primarily either the ensoulment at conception or delayed hominization. Tertullian held a view, traducianism, which was later condemned as heresy. This view held that the soul was derived from the parents and generated in parallel with the generation of the physical body. This viewpoint was deemed unsatisfactory by St. Augustine, as it did not account for original sin. Basing himself on the Septuagint version of Exodus 21:22, he affirmed the Aristotelian view of delayed hominization."}

I'm okay with that, but I think it'd be rather arrogant for a homeless man to keep demanding a better and better house (for free, no less).\n\nThis is as much a culture clash as anything, and quite frankly, I don't think the economics or practical improvements to life will ever matter as much to West Virginians as that. In order to appeal to them, the Democrats would have to basically give up on any sort of immigration reform, prison reform, or weed legalization, and we'd be stuck with two identical parties - and the rest of the country will still have their problems."}

I understand your points, but I still disagree.\n\n- I should have clarified - the difference between the Garland nomination and this one is that you've got a R president + an R congress.  The electorate chose an R congress, mostly R governors, and an R president.  The R's blocked Garland, and the public didn't seem to give a flying fuck - indeed they elected their guy as president and kept the Rs in the majority.  The republicans blocked Garland because they could get away with it.\n\nThese things tend to be cyclical, and it appears that the country in aggregate would like to see the R's give it a shot.  It'll be the dems' turn soon enough.\n\n- I completely disagree with the premise that the filibuster should not be saved because it's worthless.  They are way, way worse possibilities beyond Gorsuch.  I think if Trump were smarter, he would nominate a crony and try to undo our institutions.  I'd consider that a \"big\" item.  Gorsuch is tolerable and IMO not worth blowing up the whole system over.\n\nIn the same way that Garland was nominated to make the R's look like assholes for opposing him, Gorsuch was nominated to make the D's look like assholes for opposing him.  I'd consider filibustering Gorsuch to be trivial and a huge risk.\n\nI completely agree that the filibuster benefits the Rs more.  But I do believe the core of that party understands that they won't always be in power and would like to preserve the tools of the minority.  It's the Freedom dipshits that just want to see the whole thing burn.  Which, come to think of it, is kind of the sentiment of the electorate right now.\n\nI am really hoping to see our institutions prevail at the end of the Trump presidency.  I hope we have built a structure that is strong enough to resist getting torn apart."}

The offspring of a human is formed in that exact instant. \n\nBefore that instant, the sperm is just part of the body of the male, and the egg is just part of the body of a female. \n\nWhen they met, however, a human offspring is created, at his/her very very earliest stage of growth.\n\n&gt;Is a molar pregnancy a person?\n\nIt seems pretty clearly not. A molar pregnancy happens when tissue that normally becomes a fetus instead becomes an abnormal growth in your uterus. \n\nThere are two types that cause this: \n\nComplete molar pregnancies have only placental parts (there is no baby) and form when the sperm fertilizes an empty egg. Because the egg is empty, no baby is formed. The placenta grows and produces the pregnancy hormone, hCG. Unfortunately, an ultrasound will show that there is no fetus, only a placenta.\n\nIn this case, it's a pretty clear case of a failed attempt at creating human offspring. No person was created. \n\nSecond type: \n\nPartial molar pregnancies occurs when the mass contains both the abnormal cells and an embryo that has severe birth defects. In this case, the fetus will be overcome by the growing abnormal mass rather quickly.\n\n\nIt's possible their may have been a person created, but there is no real ability to save that person and this is an example of a failed pregnancy. Because even if a fetus is present, in most cases it's so abnormal that it can't survive, and there isn't anything we can do about that with our current level of medical tech, that I know of anyway. \n\nIn both cases, it seems like a molar pregnancy would not be considered a real person, no, due to the either lack of a fetus or the fetus being near instantly overwhelmed. \n\n"}

Still very much a Christian, but now a liberal-leaning Democrat who rejects \"cultural Christianity\". \n\nA few areas of my life that made me a Democrat:\n\n*My faith. The more intensely I studied the Bible and having spent more than 5 min with the average Evangelical Conservative, I see the Democratic Party as fulfilling the teachings of Jesus more than the Republican Party (not to say the Dems aren't flawed).\n\n*Feminism. I gained an appreciation for what women in the past have done in order for me to be who I am today. Why would I want to be part of a party that regularly treats me like a teenage girl: not letting me be who I am in order to \"protect me\" but then also wanting to punish me for not \"knowing better\"?\n\n*My studies in Social Work. Not saying that every single aspect of conservatism clashes with social work. I have social work colleagues who are very pro-social justice but have a strong preference for things being done by non-profits rather than the government. But I cannot in good conscious vote for people who try to disregard or even make a mockery of the situations my clients get into. \n\n*My move to Idaho. I grew up in Western Washington, in a tiny red patch of an otherwise blue area. I spent my whole childhood hearing every adult around me bitching about those \"damn liberals\" in Seattle and Olympia who kept imposing regulations and un-Christian laws onto them. And then I moved to Idaho for school. I really like the Gem State, but let's just say that you can tell that they don't like to spend money on anything. Whenever I drive back home to WA, I notice that the roads are so smooth. The air is so fresh and clean. Everything looks so well-kept. I hear less stories of people struggling to qualify for services. It feels safe. And most of that is thanks to the more liberal policies and taxes of the state. But if you're like my family and hometown and you don't get out much, you don't realize how good you have it."}

As bad as Assad's regime is, and as certain as we are that a bomber from Al Shayrat bombed Khan Sheikoun on the day of the mass poisoning, there isn't clear motivation for Assad or his Russian backers to antagonize the West with an attack like this. On the other hand there is plenty of history of chemical weapons use from both the pro-ISIS and pro-Al Quaed groups who have been fighting in the Khan Sheikoun area.\n\n&gt; No one disputes the fact that a Syrian air force SU-22 fighter-bomber conducted a bombing mission against a target in Khan Sheikhoun on the morning of April 4, 2017. The anti-regime activists in Khan Sheikhoun, however, have painted a narrative that has the Syrian air force dropping chemical bombs on a sleeping civilian population.\n\n&gt;A critical piece of information that has largely escaped the reporting in the mainstream media is that Khan Sheikhoun is ground zero for the Islamic jihadists who have been at the center of the anti-Assad movement in Syria since 2011. Up until February 2017, Khan Sheikhoun was occupied by a pro-ISIS group known as Liwa al-Aqsa that was engaged in an oftentimes-violent struggle with its competitor organization, Al Nusra Front (which later morphed into Tahrir al-Sham, but under any name functioning as Al Qaeda\u2019s arm in Syria) for resources and political influence among the local population.\n\n&gt;The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed that Liwa al-Aqsa was using facilities in and around Khan Sheikhoun to manufacture crude chemical shells and landmines intended for ISIS forces fighting in Iraq. According to the Russians the Khan Sheikhoun chemical weapons facility was mirrored on similar sites uncovered by Russian and Syrian forces following the reoccupation of rebel-controlled areas of Aleppo. \n\n&gt;In Aleppo, the Russians discovered crude weapons production laboratories that filled mortar shells and landmines with a mix of chlorine gas and white phosphorus; after a thorough forensic investigation was conducted by military specialists, the Russians turned over samples of these weapons, together with soil samples from areas struck by weapons produced in these laboratories, to investigators from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for further evaluation.\n\n&gt;Al Nusra has a long history of manufacturing and employing crude chemical weapons; the 2013 chemical attack on Ghouta made use of low-grade Sarin nerve agent locally synthesized, while attacks in and around Aleppo in 2016 made use of a chlorine/white phosphorous blend.  If the Russians are correct, and the building bombed in Khan Sheikhoun on the morning of April 4, 2017 was producing and/or storing chemical weapons, the probability that viable agent and other toxic contaminants were dispersed into the surrounding neighborhood, and further disseminated by the prevailing wind, is high.\n\n&gt;The counter-narrative offered by the Russians and Syrians, however, has been minimized, mocked and ignored by both the American media and the Trump administration. So, too, has the very illogic of the premise being put forward to answer the question of why President Assad would risk everything by using chemical weapons against a target of zero military value, at a time when the strategic balance of power had shifted strongly in his favor. Likewise, why would Russia, which had invested considerable political capital in the disarmament of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons capability after 2013, stand by idly while the Syrian air force carried out such an attack, especially when their was such a heavy Russian military presence at the base in question at the time of the attack?"}

Suddenly people showed up in trees refusing to leave in order to protect them from the construct crews.  I got to talking to one of them she admitted that she was paid to sit in the tree by a local environmental group.  That was basically her gig, she went around doing protests for cash.  I was horrified but I thought it was just one off instance.\n\nDuring last election we had things going where Bernie Sander's supports would disrupt Trump events even before Trump was the GOP nom over and over again, but when question they didn't seem to know anything about Bernie, it was almost like they where told to chant his name so Bernie would take the blame.\n\n\nLater Bob Creamer admitted paying those protestors for Hillary on a undercover tape.  The moment that report aired Bob Creamer dispersed from public sight and the anti-Trump disputers stopped showing up.  \n\n\nIn the hacked DNC emails admitted they use interns to show up as grass roots protesters from time to time.  People admitted to being paid to protest during occupation wallstreet as well. \n\n\nOne instance is chance, two is coincidence, but 3 is enemy action.  Thus it's likely that most left wing protests (right wings ones for all I know too) have a good percentage of people paid to protest."}

Bernie was from a rural state and still had a D- rating from the NRA but she kept attacking him for being too pro gun.

Obama dealt with unparalelled obstruction during his terms, culminating in the Merrick situation. 6 years of gridlock. I think Merrick is just a symbol of that now. The way people talk about him on Reddit you would think he's a leftist. That is obviously not the case.\n\n If we had gotten Clinton for President, they were prepared to block her SC appointments for the duration of her term. That's per John McCain, one of the more reasonable Republican senators that I know of. The current Republican Party is a loose band of reactionaries. They have no desire to work with the Democrats, that's not how they came to power. "}
