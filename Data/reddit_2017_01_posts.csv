I am refering to, of course, the Globalism vs Nationalism argument that has taken up some new traction lately. 
With people like Donald Trump winning seats of major power, and with the UK voting to leave the EU, what will this mean for the world? Is it likely to leave a lasting impact? I'd love for the input of as many people as possible, and I'd love to hear everyone's personal opinions on it as well, and why they don't agree with the other side. 

Also, consider the element of what Globalism and Nationalism mean today, compared to what they meant in the near or distant past.

Will it be in the first 100 days?

The NCRI's largest component is the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), which was designated as a terrorist group by the State Department from 1997 to 2012. The MEK led a guerrilla campaign against the U.S.-backed Shah of Iran during the 1970s, including attacks on American targets. It has since renounced violence.

James Mattis also believes that Iran is biggest threat to peace in the middle east.

They also mention:

""Without Nafta, trade between Mexico and the United States would be governed by World Trade Organization rules, Mexican trade experts say. Tariffs for imports of Mexican goods into the United States would probably rise to an average of about 3 percent, an increase that experts say is not enough to deter trade""

-https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/world/americas/trump-mexico-nafta.html

Could the WTO help Mexico as they are considered a developing country which would be dealing with tariffs from a developed country?  I am trying to get more info (specific numbers) on the GATT that goes over trade preferential between a developed and developing nation, but the best i was able to get is:

""Both GATT and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) allow developing
countries some preferential treatment""
-https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/utw_chap6_e.pdf

Based off of that lets say there is an exchange of tariffs between the two countries, wouldn't any tariff disputes taken to the WTO be favorable to Mexico as opposed to the US?

* tariff on goods coming across the border

In addition: a $0 cap on new regulations. How effective will this order be?","[Link from Reuters.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-regulations-idUSKBN15E1QU)

&gt;President Donald Trump signed an order on Monday that will seek to dramatically pare back federal regulations by requiring agencies to cut two existing regulations for every new rule introduced.

&gt;Trump's latest executive action will prepare a process for the White House to set an annual cap on the cost of new regulations, a senior official told reporters ahead of the signing. For the rest of fiscal 2017, that cap on new regulations would be $0, the official said on customary condition of anonymity.

~~The official executive order text hasn't been published on the White House website yet. I will add it here when it's released.~~

**[Link To White House Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/30/presidential-executive-order-reducing-regulation-and-controlling)**

Based off this information, what effects will this have on US regulations? Would this be an effective way of cutting excess red tape or will it harm consumers and small businesses? Will the $0 net cap on new regulations be a good way of keeping the budget under control or will it be too restrictive to be of good use?

Should a president have this power?

If yes, what are the limits, what are the guidelines to follow?

If no, should the power still exist? Can it be maybe apportioned to a separate part of the Legislative Branch?

This is a question on a systematic issue to probe for solutions.
This is not just a question to rag on Donald Trump. Other Presidents should be included in the discussion if relevant. Such as the Emancipation Proclamation with Abraham Lincoln, or Harry S Truman when he seized the steel mills during the Korean War.

On top of that these rural communities, even the ones where there is little to no economy beyond the bare essentials people need, and government welfare, there seems to be a core group who are either stuck their because they are too poor to move to a more densely populated area which is more expensive, or they just don't want to move for some reason (culture maybe?

ACS (the census) and the BLS in particular are both incredibly important for our picture of the country. But not to mention the vast amount of research done by government labs, particularly for climate issues. NREL is probably the single biggest global renewable energy research leader.

My real question is how insulated are these institutions from a president that has shown a remarkable lack of scruples in the campaign and thus far into the administration?

Is it even possible for things like unemployment numbers to get ""massaged""? Or the most alarmist of all, can they actually influence the census methods to make it so the next redistricting is less favorable to blue states in both subtle or more overt ways?

I personally like the idea of a voluntary program that can assist people that either have disabilities that make finding work hard or those who are in declining industries. It will be interesting to see how the program develops in the long term.

This movement has been created and pushed by left wing YouTube networks such as The Young Turks and Secular Talk. It launched about two maybe three days ago. The organization is also being managed by former members of Bernie Sanders campaign staff.

Their platform is effectively identical to the one that Senator Sanders ran on during his 2016 campaign. Their goal is to takeover the Democratic Party and all candidates that they run must take a pledge not to take corporate money.

1. Do you see this movement taking off the way the Tea Party did? Will they be successful in implementing their policy to the Democratic Party platform?

Yates](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-memo.html) was fired for refusing to defend Trump's recent Executive Order on Immigration.  One side effect of this decision is that there is now no one at the Justice Department who is authorized to sign FISA warrants.  The earliest replacement would come with the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General by the Senate.

What effect will this have on US Intelligence collection?  Will this have the side effect of preventing further investigation of Trump's ties with Russia?

Will the Trump admin simply ignore the FISA process and assert it has a right to collect information on anyone they please?

Edit:  With a replacement AAG on-board, it looks like FISA authority is non-issue here.  But it appears we are in a constitutional crisis nonetheless.

If any of them gets ballot access -- which seems likely -- it will be the first time that an incumbent has faced a primary challenger in more than 30 years. It's also been roughly the same amount of time since a Democrat has won a second term as NYC mayor. 

On the Republican side, there are scant few well-known names in the ""potential"" pool, and the few who have declared already highlight the different party segmentations (a businessman, a clergyman, and even a network TV actor -- all of whom have access to external money with millions of dollars already in their coffers).

Mayor of New York is considered one of the most powerful political positions in the country. It seems likely that the partisan divides highlighted in the presidential election will be front and center. Republicans will be confronted on their support for Donald Trump (who lost resoundingly among NYC voters) while De Blasio (and other Democratic challengers) will be hit over questions of whether or not they can actually deliver on their rhetoric. 

De Blasio also faces questions over things like failing to call the recent NYC bombs an act of ""terror"" (even though his Democratic colleague, Governor Cuomo, had no such qualms); questioning the integrity of his own police department; and a handful of other issues (potentially using his influence to get a friend released from police custody; programs to help the homeless which have seen tremendous faults and anger from homeless and non-homeless advocates alike; etc). However, reports indicate he may have personally preferred Bernie Sanders, meaning he wasn't necessarily part of the Democratic ""establishment"" image that the party is now trying to shed. Concerns raise over why he didn't state his positive thoughts about Sanders publicly, though. 

All of these issues are a microcosm of the emotions felt throughout the country, although NYC is certainly a very different landscape. Republicans are likely to have a difficult time appealing to voters due to the stain that Trump has set on the Republican brand (with that stain being exceptionally and uniquely toxic in New York). But De Blasio, with approval ratings often below 50%, has challenges too.

What do you expect to see in the next 10 months as this process unfolds?"5q3sh9,1485358266,I_See_Wrong_People,Could switching parties for the primary elections mend some of our party polarization in America?,"The Republican Party used to have a liberal wing, and there are still southern Democrats that could be called conservative. Ideological sorting in the parties is relatively recent, could it be reversed via the primary system?

Is it possible to mobilize liberal voters to participate in the Republican primaries to push moderates or even liberals? Is it possible for conservatives to mobilize to push moderate Democrats? 

The numbers seem to favor this. Ted Cruz won his senate seat in the Republican Primary runoff with only about 600,000 votes in 2012 in Texas. His opponent, David Dewhearst got about 400K, for a total of 1 million votes cast in the Republican primary runoff.

Hillary and Bernie turned out 1.3 Million to vote in the Democratic Presidential primary race in 2016 in Texas.

Can people look past their tribalism to work for a reasonable opposition? Is this beyond the pale and unsupportable by the parties themselves? The voter psychology seems to be the most difficult thing to overcome here. 

The Tea Party managed to manipulate the primary system to push non-traditional business conservatives from office.

How likely is it that intra-party dissension will delay a repeal?","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/repeal-affordable-care-act-donald-trump.html

&gt; President-elect Donald J. Trump pressed Republicans on Tuesday to move forward with the immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act and to replace it very quickly thereafter, saying, â€œWe have to get to business. Obamacare has been a catastrophic event.â€ù

&gt; Mr. Trumpâ€™s position undercuts Republican leaders who want a quick vote to repeal President Obamaâ€™s signature domestic achievement but who also want to wait as long as two to three years to come up with an alternative. But he was also challenging the resolve of nervous Republicans in Congress who do not want any vote on a repeal until that replacement exists.

&gt; Mr. Trump, who seemed unclear about the timing of already scheduled votes in Congress this week, demanded a repeal vote â€œprobably some time next week,â€ù and said â€œthe replace will be very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.â€ù

&gt; That demand is very likely impossible. Republicans in Congress are nowhere close to agreement on a major health bill that would replace President Obamaâ€™s signature domestic achievement. A number of Republicans in the House and Senate have said publicly that they wanted to hold off on voting to eviscerate the health law until a replacement measure could be negotiated.

&gt; For now, the Senate is planning to vote Thursday morning on a budget resolution that would set up parliamentary protections for a health care repeal bill that would have to emerge from House and Senate committees by Jan. 27. The House would vote on Friday if that budget measure clears the Senate.

&gt; That plan is under pressure from Republicans who want to slow the process as they struggle for an agreement on what would follow repeal.

The Senators who want a replacement simultaneously with repeal are Rand Paul of Kentucky, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and Bob Corker of Tennessee. 

Trump appears to be siding with the Congressmen who want to repeal ACA, then propose a replacement afterwards. But with conflicting interests in the GOP, is it possible that the repeal is delayed indefinitely?"5n8su3,1484094068,Precursor2552,Posting Guide and the Wiki!,"In order to try and make the experience of posting easier we have made use of our wiki!

A notable line from his speech was:

&gt; ""Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room. Wind and rain may be kept outside, but so is light and air.""

Free trade and globalization are major topics in the international political conversation at the moment, because of the UK's Brexit position, concerns over the eurozone, and President-Elect Trump's rhetoric on trade. With the US at least positioning itself to turn away from free trade, including rejecting the TPP, and China countering by pursuing the RCEP, could China's seeming defence of free trade have political consequences, both in the US and in Europe?

Two notable quotes; 

&gt;""The U.S. Congress has made the possession of marijuana in every state, and distribution of it, an illegal act. So if that's not desired any longer, Congress should pass a law to change the rule.""

And in regards to medical marijauna policy set forth by the Obama Administration;

&gt; ""I won't commit to never enforcing federal law, Senator Leahy,"" Sessions replied. ""I think some of [the Obama-era guidelines] are truly valuable in evaluating cases,"" he added. ""Using good judgment about how to handle these cases will be a responsibility of mine. I know it won't be an easy decision, but I will try to do my duty in a fair and just way.""

""Since I took office, we have put the Cuban-American community at the center of our policies.

&gt; Havana has long argued the policy encourages Cubans to make the dangerous crossing from Cuba to Florida. Immigrants from other nations have argued the policy amounts to preferential treatment for one group.

This has happened in a broad variety of electoral systems:

**Poland, 2015** - PiS wins a majority in the Sejm with 37.58% of the popular vote in a proportional representation system.

**USA, 2016** - Donald Trump wins the presidency with ~46% of the PV in a series of 51 first-past-the-post elections (the electoral college). Republicans win the House and Senate with 49.1% of the popular vote in the House in a series of 435 FPTP elections (Senate is n/a because two Democrats ran against each other in California).

**The Philippines, 2016** - Rodrigo Duterte wins the presidency with ~38% of the vote in a single FPTP election.

**Hungary, 2014** - Fidesz wins a majority with ~45% of the vote in a mixed proportional-FPTP election.

**Denmark, 2015** - DF acts as a *de facto* coalition partner, winning 21.1% of the popular vote in a proportional election (second place).

**Finland, 2015** - Perussuomalaiset acts as a junior coalition partner, gaining 17.7% of the popular vote in a proportional election.

Are some political systems more susceptible to right-wing/populist candidates?

**Neil Gorsuch:**

* Son of former EPA head Anne Gorsuch Burford under Reagan
* **Education:**  Columbia(B.A.), Harvard(JD), Oxford(P.h.D): 
* Strong ratings from the Federalist Society with also praise from the Heritage Foundation
* Strong religious liberty decisions and gun rulings
* 49 years old
* Has been on the 10th circuit for 10 years which means a lot information about decisions can be gathered.


**Thomas Hardiman:**

* 51 years old
* **Education:** Notre Dame(B.A.) Georgetown(JD): Would be the only person on the court to not attend an Ivy League law school, but Georgetown is a top 10-15 law school in rankings. 
* Strong Heritage Foundation ranking with some Federalist Society support
* One of the strongest gun supporting federal justices in the country

**William Pryor:**

* 54 Years old
* **Education:** University of Louisiana, Monroe (B.A.), Tulane University (J.D.)
* Extremely Conservative across the board
* Former Attorney General of Alabama 
* Some Federalist Society support but more from The Heritage Foundation

**Opinion**

1) Gorsuch and Hardiman would get scrutiny and vetting just like any other SCOTUS pick from any other president but would would easily get support could even pass the Filibuster if Democrats chose to do it(unlucky with them).

2) Pryor no way of getting passed, Democrats would filibuster and Republicans would find a hard time to get more than 8 Democrats to switch.


**My guess**

**Pick:** Gorsuch.

**Others**

1) Hardiman: If Kennedy retires he'll replace him, esspically because Kennedy has said he wants a Republican President to replace him on the court.

2) Pryor: Was used as a prop to get Social-Conservatives to vote

What will be the likely findings?","https://www.yahoo.com/news/white-house-defends-trumps-debunked-claim-of-massive-voter-fraud-maybe-will-investigate-200244102.html

&gt;White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday doubled down on President Trumpâ€™s claim that millions of people voted illegally in the recent presidential election, despite widespread evidence to the contrary.

&gt;â€œThe president does believe that,â€ù Spicer told reporters during a media briefing.

&gt;Trump, who had previously made the debunked claim, reportedly repeated it again Monday during a White House reception, where he said 3 to 5 million votes were cast by people who illegally immigrated to the U.S. Trump uses this assertion to argue that he won the popular vote against Hillary Clinton, who beat him by nearly 3 million votes overall.

&gt;Though fact-checkers and independent analysis have never found evidence of widespread voter fraud, Spicer would not back down from Trumpâ€™s comments.

&gt;â€œHeâ€™s stated his concerns about voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign, and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him,â€ù Spicer said.

&gt;No credible study supports Trumpâ€™s claim, and the only study Spicer cited does not support the president on the issue.

&gt;Reporters continued to grill Spicer on the topic throughout the briefing, with more than one journalist asking whether the Trump administration would launch an investigation if there were actually massive electoral fraud. â€œMaybe we will,â€ù Spicer said at one point.

With such a large amount of votes being cast throughout the country, what kind of effort will be needed to count them all again and verify that no significant illegal voting has taken place? If President Trump is considering such an investigation, what is the most likely and efficient route that he can take to do this?

Some of this has legitimate reasoning IMO. 

Generally, a home (or in this case a condo) is the largest capital investment a person will ever make in their life. If I decide to build a landfill next to your condo and your property values go negative you are seriously fucked, not only in lost investment money, but now you can't move unless you can make up the difference between the low selling price and the actual mortgage cost which you probably don't have that lump sum lying around. Not being able to move severely limits your economic dynamism, which in turn makes it harder for you to adapt to sudden shifts such as long term job losses. As an example if you are a tech worker, and your SF condo went under water, and Silicon Valley suddenly packed up and moved to Cleveland you would be stuck with less job choices while everyone mobile now moves to Cleveland. This is how long term structural unemployment starts.

On the other hand lets not kid ourselves, a lot of this also has racial and class based undertones. Look no further than Georgetown in Washington DC. For those who don't know Georgetown is an area of DC known for high priced everything. Living there is basically the stamp of ""I am rich and superior to you"" Everything is overpriced, even the stupid cupcakes (I'm looking at you Georgetown Cupcakes). One of the interesting things about Georgetown, is that even though it is in the middle of the city, which, until it started breaking, and catching on fire, had decent subway lines to the point where people could afford to not have a car, Georgetown was always a pain in the ass to get to. Why? It has lobbied many times to prevent public transit from going directly to it. The unofficial reason that everyone in DC knows is that it is because they don't want ""those people"" (read black people, poor people etc) coming to their neighborhood. In short, in the extreme, zoning laws can be used to artificially inflate property values of people lucky enough to already live somewhere, and beyond the money, people love exclusivity. Who doesn't want to live in the ""cool"" neighborhood? In general I have found cool means it has cool stuff combined with it having limited housing supply making someone living there unique. This has the downside of inflating property values making a housing crunch like we are seeing in major coastal cities.

When it comes to the policy of reparations, itâ€™s usually rebutted with â€œthe Civil Was was 150 years agoâ€ù or  â€œWeâ€™ve moved on from racism of the 1950sâ€ù. We may have, but are the effects still in having a profound impact on African Americans 2017?
One of the most powerful racist polices was redlining. It was a tool used by the FHA for 34 years (1934-68) that basically made homeownership accessible to whites and explicitly refused to back loans to black people or those that lived near black people. Yes, an outright policy of racism per The Atlantic:

&gt;The FHA insured private mortgages, causing a drop in interest rates and a decline in the size of the down payment required to buy a house. But an insured mortgage was not a possibility for Clyde Ross. The FHA had adopted a system of maps that rated neighborhoods according to their perceived stability. On the maps, green areas, rated â€œA,â€ù indicated â€œin demandâ€ù neighborhoods that, as one appraiser put it, lacked â€œa single foreigner or Negro.â€ù These neighborhoods were considered excellent prospects for insurance. Neighborhoods where black people lived were rated â€œDâ€ù and were usually considered ineligible for FHA backing. They were colored in red. Neither the percentage of black people living there nor their social class mattered. Black people were viewed as a contagion. Redlining went beyond FHA-backed loans and spread to the entire mortgage industry, which was already rife with racism, excluding black people from most legitimate means of obtaining a mortgage. [Source]( https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/)

As you can see, the government was complicit in the creation of poor and crime ridden neighborhoods in favor of white, affluent ones. These policies extended to other benefits such as the GI Bill â€“ where black veterans were typically shunned from low interest home loans.

These ripple effects was not limited to housing but infected schooling, business, employment, law and order. Blacks would be afflicted with poor education, be denied business, employment and still be brutalized by police which was only amplified by redlining. 

This is on top of centuries of enslavement along with oppressive Jim crow racism and violence. Slavery was a key foundation for the American governmental system that it was founded upon and so it would be expected that a civil war would break out when something so ingrained would be fundamentally changed. 

When the 13th amendment passed, it prohibited slavery with an important exception:  involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime. This created a system of [convict leasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict_lease) where states essentially sold prison labor to private parties such as plantation owners. The selective and harsh enforcement of the laws resulted in overwhelming amount of black males being arrested and be a part of this convict lease system. By in large, the convict lease system exploited the exception in the 13th amendment to keep a form of slavery alive for the south.

The treatment of blacks was improving at an extremely marginal pace. The harsh treatment just has simply been more covert as time has passed. So instead of outright enslavement and convict leasing it became the revocation of rights, privileges and immunities, and a lot of things of everyday life enjoyed by their white counterparts.


Then it slowly devolved to coded language as Lee Atwater explained:

&gt;Atwater: You start out in 1954 by saying, ""N----r, N----r, N----r."" By 1968 you can't say ""N----r""â€”that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow meâ€”because obviously sitting around saying, ""We want to cut this,"" is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ""N----r,N----r.


So my question is this: Should the United States embark to make reparations as part of public policy?

As with the source linked above, I encourage you to read the article from the Atlantic for more insight on reparations: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"5p8u0e,1484973338,abnrib,"If the ACA is repealed, can we expect more repeals to follow?

How can we rely on the same polling that got it so wrong on election night? None of the ""poll of polls"" predicted it, and only a few outlying polls had Trump ahead before election night.

*IF* the polls are right on how historically unpopular he is going into his Presidency, does it even matter? The 2018 map heavily skews conservative. It would take another unprecedented shift for the conservatives to be ""punished"" on election night in 2018. They might loose some seats, but never enough to loose control.
Couldn't they easily do as the please until 2018, take a few hits, then spend the next 18 months ""repackaging"" themselves?

"5oiziw,1484670328,Jamlad8,Does Polybius' cyclical theory of Anacyclosis seem relevant to 21st century democracy?,"For those unaware of his theory it is very simple. Polybius argued in his theory of Anacyclosis that three basic forms of government monarchy, aristocracy and democracy would in time decay into malignant forms of government tyranny, oligarchy and ochlocracy (mob rule). 

(More depth if you're interested) From Wikipedia :
The state begins in a form of primitive monarchy. The state will emerge from monarchy under the leadership of an influential and wise king; this represents the emergence of ""kingship"". Political power will pass by hereditary succession to the children of the king, who will abuse their authority for their own gain; this represents the degeneration of kingship into ""tyranny"".

Some of the more influential and powerful men of the state will grow weary of the abuses of tyrants, and will overthrow them; this represents the ascendancy of ""aristocracy"" (as well as the end of the ""rule by the one"" and the beginning of the ""rule by the few"").

Just as the descendants of kings, however, political influence will pass to the descendants of the aristocrats, and these descendants will begin to abuse their power and influence, as the tyrants before them; this represents the decline of aristocracy and the beginning of ""oligarchy"". As Polybius explains, the people will by this stage in the political evolution of the state decide to take political matters into their own hands.

This point of the cycle sees the emergence of ""democracy"", as well as the beginning of ""rule by the many"". In the same way that the descendants of kings and aristocrats abused their political status, so too will the descendants of democrats. Accordingly, democracy degenerates into ""ochlocracy"", literally, ""mob-rule"". During ochlocracy, according to Polybius, the people of the state will become corrupted, and will develop a sense of entitlement and will be conditioned to accept the pandering of demagogues.

Eventually, the state will be engulfed in chaos, and the competing claims of demagogues will culminate in a single (sometimes virtuous) demagogue claiming absolute power, bringing the state full-circle back to monarchy."5pjm0s,1485118797,amccarsh,Trump has announced he will go meet with Mexican and Canadian leaders about renegotiating NAFTA.

It comes after Trump â€” who has long been critical of vaccines â€” met at Trump Tower with Kennedy, who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws.

&gt;â€œThe President-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas,â€ù Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. â€œThe President-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time.

General violent crime rates followed similar trends as homicides did specifically.

The data shows violent crime rates falling sharply starting in the 30s, staying low for about 20 years, and then increasing sharply starting in the 60s.

The fall in violent crime rates in the 30s and 40s seems to be fairly easy to explain (although easy answers are, of course, not always correct) â€” since young men directly commit most violent crime and poverty tends to contribute to crime, it makes sense that the end of an economic depression plus millions of young men being sent overseas during WW2 would have caused crime rates to drop.

But why did crime rates go up so much in the 1960s? I suspect that part of the increase may have been simply a rebound to pre-war levels that the war had temporarily suppressed, but since the US economy was doing better in the 60s than it had been in the 30s, it seems that other factors must have been involved."5otxwi,1484792840,RBNEXUS,"Over 150 cities and counties in the United States have now adopted ""Ban the Box"" initiatives prohibiting employment applications from asking about criminal history.

One of the side-topics that the report went into was this:

&gt; In theory, AI-driven automation might involve more than temporary disruptions in labor markets and drastically reduce the need for workers. If there is no need for extensive human labor in the production process, society as a whole may need to find an alternative approach to resource allocation other than compensation for labor, requiring a fundamental shift in the way economies are organized. 

What I hear most often in discussions concerning automation is, of course, [UBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income). People have good arguments on both sides of the UBI discussion, but I was wondering if that would be enough for the scenario that the gov't report has speculated.

According to the [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-33.html), 62.7% of the American population lives in cities, and that number is expected to climb in the coming years. Statistics also show that most cities also tend to vote democrat in elections. ([source: Pew research](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/21/the-growing-democratic-domination-of-nations-largest-counties/)) Because of this, some people think a popular vote system would be tyranny of the majority or ""mob rule"" since it would give cities and democrats an advantage population wise. These people worry that cities would dominate every election and that rural voters wouldn't ever have a say. 

If we repeal the electoral college, should rural voters have increased representation (like having their votes count more) to prevent only cities from deciding? Or do those cities deserve to have more representation since a majority of Americans live in them? Do you agree or disagree that tyranny of the majority is a real problem in a popular vote system?

On the flip side, Democrats narrowed the gap in Texas down to 9 points.

We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery ,we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.""

This struck me as resonating with a lot of today's politics, particularly the debate over emotional reasoning vs. logical reasoning. I've heard it said many a time on the internet that liberals in particular are ""too emotional"" or base their arguments too much on their ""feelings."" 

Basically what I'm asking is, do you think this is necessarily a bad thing?

Now that the precedent has been set that it's acceptable to hold a seat open to prevent the opposing party from filling it, I'm wondering if it's really much of a stretch to extend that to 2 years, or a full presidential term.

Democrats will certainly have incentive to exact some sort of vengeance for the seat they can argue was stolen from them. In the event that they take the Senate back in 2018, I could easily see them blockading any vacancy that might arise between then and 2020.

Republicans, having faced no repercussions for keeping the Court at 8 justices for a year, would probably have no incentive not to go for two years if the situation were to arise again.

Having established that, I'm wondering if we'll ever see an attempted blockade of an entire 4 year term. It doesn't seem out of the question at all. I can easily see a scenario where if Dems took back the Senate in 2020 while Trump won reelection, they'd refuse to confirm anyone until 2024, particularly if they felt good about the 2022 midterms.

Looking at the gubernatorial election map over the next few years, it looks like it will be pretty tough to defend that margin. The issue is that there aren't really any red-state Democrats up for election, but there are a host of blue and purple state Republican governors who will either be term-limited or up for reelection.

Term-limited:
New Jersey (Chris Christie),
Florida (Rick Scott),
Maine (Paul LePage),
Michigan (Rick Snyder),
Nevada (Brian Sandoval),
New Mexico (Susana Martinez),
Ohio (John Kasich)

There are also a lot of governors who aren't term-limited, but could lose given the fundamentals of their state if popular opinion turns against Trump:

Illinois (Bruce Rauner),
Maryland (Larry Hogan),
Massachusetts (Charlie Baker),
New Hampshire (Chris Sununu),
Vermont (Phil Scott),
Wisconsin (Scott Walker)

Baker in Massachusetts and Hogan in Maryland are two of the most popular governors in the country, so those mansions may not be winnable. But Rauner is very unpopular, Phil Scott is new, and Walker is controversial.

There's also the possibility that Dan Malloy could lose in Connecticut, as he is very unpopular, which would offset a Republican loss.

I assume Dems would be the favorites in New Jersey, Maine, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Vermont unless Trump manages to be surprisingly popular. The others might be toss-ups, with Massachusetts and Maryland as long-shots.

Unlike that of Clear Channel when radio deregulated, neither company has gotten much press for their growth as minus a few cases their holdings miss the largest markets.

Right now, both Sinclair and Nexstar are abutting the 39% of the US cap set by the FCC in 2003; this amount is not a true 39% as stations that were UHF prior to the digital transition still count as half a station versus analog-era VHF allocations. The speculation has been that a Republican-led FCC would further lift any caps (under Michael Powell/GWB it went from 35%) and possibly cancel a plan to sunset the UHF discount, however during the last Republican administration many groups shrunk in size including the aforementioned Sinclair and since Telcom 96 the pattern has been to buy big while Democrats are in power and digest/sell when Republicans are in power.

This act by Congress requires only a simple majority (no filibuster in the Senate) in each house and is subject to a presidential veto.

There's a fact sheet about the CRA [here](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43992.pdf) and a pretty interesting WSJ article [here](http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-gop-regulatory-game-changer-1485478085).

The concern with this Act is that it appears there were many Obama executive actions that fall under the definition of ""rule"" in the CRA, but for which reports weren't submitted. The Trump administration could then submit reports for these actions, giving Congress 60 days to overturn the regulation.  This might not be too bad, executive agencies undo executive work all the time, except 801(b)(2) provides:

&gt;A rule that does not take effect (or does not continue) under paragraph (1) may not be reissued in substantially the same form, and a new rule that is substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued, unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.

So if Congress undoes an Obama-era rule this way, no future administration can re-enact that rule unless they can get legislation passed through Congress.

Do you think this is a tool Republicans will actually use? Or will Obama's executive actions be sufficiently popular to protect them?

&gt;Marine Le Pen's vision is designed to expand the party's appeal and reassure those voters who are nervy about the National Front's hard-line policies towards the EU. Asked in an interview earlier this week whether she would pull France out of the Brussels bloc, Ms Le Pen said: ""No, I think we need to renegotiate with the EU to bring back sovereignty to France, backed by a referendum.""

Given the second round of the election is likely to be between her and the self-described Thatcherite Francois Fillon, does this softening improve her chances?"5ppucu,1485189463,iamthegodemperor,What Possible Coalitions Could Create Democratic Party That Would Reverse Urban/Rural Divide?,"Some ink has been spilled on urban/rural divide. But less has been written about the coalitions that create that division. Given that the current alignment puts the Democratic party into a semi-permanent minority position it seems a new set of constituents is necessary to make Democrats viable again.

Thomas Hardiman currently sits on the 3rd circuit court of appeals and is the front runner to replace Scalia.

His ideology is rather interesting when you see how to clashes with regard to ""liberty"" in the eyes of a justice such as Anthony Kennedy. I'll explain in detail:

**Gun Rights**

Hardiman authored an opinion in  Drake v. Filko that took an expansive view towards gun rights. Basically he states that the 2A protects gun rights beyond the home (a question left unanswered by the SCOTUS in Heller).

**1st Amendment**


However he follows the path of William Rehnquist with respect to free speech rights - wherein that he favors restrictions to it:

In  Easton Area School District v. B.H. (The ""I [Heart] Boobies"" bracelet case) where he dissented writing that the speech falls into a gray area of ""lewdness"".

Perhaps more troubling is his view on recording the police. In Kelly v. Borough of Carlisle, he wrote that due to insufficient case law, the recording of police was not justified by the 1A. This is a troubling view that indicates his potential skepticism of first amendment rights as the broader third circuit has embraced this opinion and concluded that videotaping without an expressive purpose may not be protected.

**4th Amendment**

Hardiman ruled in favor of the gov't in  Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders (later upheld by 5-4 SCOTUS) that upheld strip searches of arrestees even if there is no basis to strip search.

With that being said, I have two questions:

* Do you support a justice with the views annotated above?
* If you are a general supporter of expansive view of rights/freedom enshrined by the constitution, is it worth the the narrowing of 1st/4th amendment rights in favor of expansive 2nd amendment rights?"5qkffq,1485558850,trooperdx3117,Have the allegations against Francois Fillon shifted the French Presidential election in LaPen favour?,"Francois Fillon is one of the front runners for the office of French President. It's been predicted that the election would come down to between Fillon and LaPen. 

However recently allegations have come out Fillon paid his wife â‚¬500,000 for parliamentary secretary work she never carried out (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/26/french-presidential-hopeful-francois-fillon-denies-claims-about-wife)

Does everyone think this has swung the presidential election in LaPens favour as Fillon appears to voter as another corrupt politician. 

Also is there any hope for Macron who has seemed to be gathering up some steam as a left wing candidate? "5qpeg2,1485632109,shinyskarmory,Would an American 'foreign legion' be politically palatable as a path to naturalization?,"France has long maintained a [Foreign Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion) composed of soldiers from other nations, mostly former French colonial possessions. After either three years of service or being wounded in combat, non-French citizens are eligible to apply for French citizenship. Other nations like China and Israel have adopted similar programs based on the French model.

Do you think a similar US program could be a practical part of an immigration reform package? And if it could be, do you think it could acquire enough bipartisan support to pass Congress?"5qtde6,1485689201,Ddog312,Recently Eastern Washington Threatened to Secede from Washington.
