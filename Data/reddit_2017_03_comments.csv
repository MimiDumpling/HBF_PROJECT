Days prior on May 15, 2013, Attorney General Holder had testified under oath in front of the House Judiciary Committee that he had recused himself from the leak investigations to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. Holder said his Deputy Attorney General, James M. Cole, was in charge of the AP investigation and would have ordered the subpoenas.[16] When questioning turned to the possibility of journalists being charged under the Espionage Act for reporting classified material, Holder stated: ""With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I've ever been involved in, heard of or would think would be a wise policy.""[17]

On May 23, 2013, NBC confirmed with the Justice Department that Holder had personally signed off on the Rosen case. The Justice Department defended their decision and spoke about a balance between protecting national secrets and the 1st Amendment, stating: ""After extensive deliberations, and after following all applicable laws, regulations and policies, the Department sought an appropriately tailored search warrant under the Privacy Protection Act.""[18] The revelation brought into question whether Holder was being intentionally misleading during his previous testimony when he denied knowing of, or being part of possible prosecutions of journalists. House Committee members sent an open letter to Holder, saying: ""It is imperative that the committee, the Congress, and the American people be provided a full and accurate account of your involvement.""[19]"dfhofhv,1490659717,lee1026,dfhpn97,"It isn't a hurdle, it is a feature.

I don't think it is necessarily legit to compare our defense budget with other countries. We have friendly neighbors and are oceans apart from the rest of the world. Defense of our borders and ""the homeland"" (that phrase seems evil, somehow) should not cost more than any other nation and may cost much less (because of our geographic fortune). 

If we spend just what was necessary for actual defense of the USA, and contributed nicely to the UN, and participated in UN peacekeeping missions (while paying our fair share of the US costs), I suspect we could cut our defense budget tremendously. The money saved on defense could go to social programs (that would benefit all of us) or just to tax cuts (which would benefit some). 

Our fantasy that is our destiny to be the policeman for the world (while paying this ourselves) is enriching a few but robbing many.

I strongly suspect that much of our defense budget is just being poured down a rat hole, and foreign dictators and 'strong men' we are propping up, and defense contractors are making huge profits, while we debate finding pocket change to subsidize public broadcasting or the arts... 

But the military industrial complex has very good lobbyists, and probably owns many congresscritters, so we will never change and debate is nice but meaningless -- (lobbyist) money talks louder. "decctpy,1488328392,der_triad,decglgi,"This logic isn't consistent.

Second, as it stands, companies do not know if someone is at high risk for one issues or another until that medical malady actually happens. People can be at risk for diabetes because of family history, but make healthy life choices that means they never develop it. Someone could show no genetic issues in their family history, but be an unhygienic fat slob who will kill themselves early regardless.

But if this bill were to pass, the person making healthy life choices to stall, stop, or control potential genetic pitfalls will be treated the same as the fat slob. Joe and Dan could both be highly skilled and healthy programmers, but if Joe's family genetics show a high risk for an expensive disease while Dan comes out clean, Dan will get the job offers every time, and the best Joe can hope for is a pay cut to offset what the company deems an ""expensive risk"", or not be offered employer-paid insurance at all.

Genetics is unchangeable, but that doesn't mean someone should be punished for it and fated to always earn less than someone who is not. Look at Stephen Hawking - one of the most brilliant minds on the planet but with an extremely genetically undesirable body. Yet because medically he was supported by a socialized health program - genetics be damned - he was able to continue living and continue contributing to the world. His children are treated no differently either.

You're setting up a false dichotomy.  It's to parse words in the context of actions.  Every legal analysis starts with words.  Sure, actions are invoked to assess the meaning/accuracy of words.  But ultimately judges are performing an act of textual interpretation.  It's exactly the fact that the law takes words seriously that gives it power. Even if an attorney makes a ""lawyerly"" evasion or justification, they're still required to justify an action in reference to a principle.  

I only work in patent law rather than criminal law or tort law, but Trump's every statement drives me and my co-workers completely insane--because it's obvious trump doesn't take words seriously.

Trump files obvious no merit lawsuits, and when called to defend himself tells straight up lies--not lawyerly evasions that are true ""from a certain point of view"". He'll make a statement in public and then-- instead of arguing the meaning of his words--will straight up deny he said them.  And when people hold him responsible for his words--he gets incensed because they're ""just words"" and he should actually be credited for the secret feelings in his heart.

And all this would be fine if he were a private individual.  Sure, it'd make him an annoying asshole, but people have that right.  

But as president he's not just a person but the senior government executive.  He has immense power, which is only constrained by the fact that the presidency is an office defined and circumscribed by laws.  

You can say that's bullshit, but look at the enhanced interrogation debacle with Bush--his desire to have at least a  paper shield meant that he a) didn't argue (in publIc, anyway) that torture was ok, and b) constrained him to do it off of US shores.  

Now imagine the same situation with trump.  Trump would say ""light em up! The terrorists deserve torture!""--and then turn around and go to court to say ""it's not torture, I didn't say that"".  You think trump would limit torture to black sites? Because he doesn't proactively try to legally justify his actions, he's technically able to push boundaries way further than any normal person would.

I'd argue that the judiciary's skeptical treatment of trump is entirely justified.

A) He frequently says completely untrue things and distorts reality to fit his own narrative

B) He gives press that agrees with him access to the white house, and is actively fighting against independent journalism.

C) He has not proposed any legislation to a Republican majority Congress, preferring to act through executive order, where he has grossly overstepped executive power with his travel ban.

* Ryan *knows* that they're fucked on this, and the House decided that they'd just go ahead and get it out there, to pretend that they're doing *something*. Kind of like when you turn something in half baked and hope you get credit for the effort.

* Neither McConnell nor Ryan really understand what they're up against, and they think that Republican Governors in purple states (and their Senators) will go along with them on this because of the two-year fig leaf.

* Ryan thinks he can browbeat McConnell and Senate Republicans into trying their hand at improving this shit sandwich in hopes to barely get it through the Senate.

Maybe there are other scenarios at play, but those are the first that come to mind for me. Of those, the first seems the most likely - the second and third seem preposterously out of touch, *even* for Republican Party leadership.

&gt;There are many ways to debate immigration, but when it comes to economics, there isnâ€™t much of a debate at all. Nearly all economists, of all political persuasions, agree that immigrants 
â€” those here legally or not â€” benefit the overall economy. â€œThat is not controversial,â€ù Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, told me. Shierholz also said that â€œthere is a consensus that, on average, the incomes of families in this country are increased by a small, but clearly positive amount, because of immigration.â€ù

Also:

&gt;The available evidence suggests that immigration leads to more innovation, a better educated workforce, greater occupational specialization, better matching of skills with jobs, and higher overall economic productivity.

THis is simply false. the ACA is almost entirely about expanding coverage. NONE of its major provisions does anything to reduce costs.

There is so much wrong with this statement I don't know where to begin. For one things, ACTUALLY READ THE LAW. You've been so focused on the first 8 pages that you've neglected the next 900, which is where the meat of healthcare savings are from. Also learn about healthcare economics; there are even great intro books to healthcare reform like Ezekiel Emanuel's book on the ACA, designed for a lay person like you.

What you will learn if you actually interact with the healthcare system is that there is no one umbrella solution to fix healthcare because it is MANY THINGS that together cause high costs in the United States. Everything I mentioned in my description above tackles one of those many things by reducing the cost a little. EHRs are one of many ways in which we are trying to cut inefficiencies from the system. (side note: you need to get better sources. Your website is not a peer-reviewed healthcare policy journal like Health Affairs but rather an opinion piece from a partisan website). Last I heard, about 60% of healthcare costs in the US arises from inefficiencies that can be streamlined. The ACA helps make a thousand small tweaks in order to achieve the goals. I compare the changes to changing greenhouse emissions standards in cars. In the grand scheme of things, they will have little impact on climate change but they are an important stepping stone. Radical things like forcing everyone to give up meat won't be enactable. And in contrary to your 'tiny pilot programs,' Accountable Care Organizations have been quite a successful model that was adopted by providers of Blue Cross/Blue Shields Massachusetts and Kaiser Permanente. Read the article on the Alternative Quality Contract by Dana Safran in Health Affairs, which describes one version of this payment model.

Also, I don't know where you are getting your knowledge but getting insured does lower the overall cost, not just the average cost per person. How? The majority of high costs occur when a medical situation has gotten so bad that critical care has to be done on the patient. For example, if you had an infection and you put it off until you are hospitalized from septic shock, you have just costed the American healthcare system thousands of dollars when you could have gotten it looked at earlier and simply taken an antibiotic. Likewise if you are detected with cancer earlier, you will get treated with chemo, possibly surgery and have a decently good chance of survival (say 40-70%, depending on the cancer). But if you wait until you are in Stage 3 cancer, at that point, everything is incredibly expensive to treat. You are doing several surgeries to remove tumors, trying the newest fancy drugs in desperation, all in all very expensive. This is common among people who don't have health insurance. Why? Because it's expensive to see a specialist. Hence, not having insurance ends up placing a burdern on paying patients, since the cost is off-loaded to them. Hence, having health insurance enables people to get screened at low cost and treated before the situation gets worse. 

Side note: providing FREE healthcare has been linked with INCREASED costs; this is highly reproducible among many famous studies, including a recent on the journal Science. This is one reason why economists DO NOT recommend Americans become a single-payer system. The reason is people like using things when it is free. So if you had options, you would pick the newest and more expensive therapy rather than one that works, and you would also use things when you don't need to, leading to overuse of capacity. This is why economists recommend using a co-pay so people don't overuse things when they don't need to. This model is what France uses for their 'single-payer' system, and has been quite successful at keeping costs and usage lower."dfmvygw,1490930909,LovecraftInDC,dfmwy32,"Really?

If China believes the South Koreans and Japanese will obtain their own respective nuclear weapons to deter the new North Korean threat then China will be more willing to threaten to cut off critical food and fuel supplies to the North Koreans. The North Korean economy is the size of a city in Ohio (Dayton I think Friedman said, if I recall correctly) so without Chinese aid the North Korea would suffer greatly. Now, China does not want a refugee crisis at its northern border should the North Korean regime totally collapse. If the North Korean leaders remain obstinate and bellicose--and obtain nuclear ICBMs-- the Chinese may feel enough pressure to exercise these economic levers in lieu of a direct strike from U.S. and allied forces.

Right now the US has very minimal VAT/sales tax and high corporate and income taxes, this means our government is funded by businesses and people that work here. Other countries with higher VAT/sales taxes are funded on the backs of companies and individuals that buy and sell things in those countries.

So if you export from the US to a VAT country, you're taxed twice, and if you export from a VAT country to the US you avoid those taxes on both ends.

This is where Trump is bashing our trade deals, it's not that free trade is bad in principle, it's that we don't really have it when countries can mix taxing at production and consumption to create the same effect as trade barriers.

Messing with currency valuation can have a similar effect, lower value currency makes exports easier and brings jobs to your country.

Now, these policies do help some people in our economy.

[Judge Grants Search Warrant For Everyone Who Searched a Crime Victim's Name On Google](http://pipedot.org/article/2G7RJ)

&gt; Hennepin County District Judge Gary Larson has issued a search warrant to Edina, Minnesota police to collect information on people who searched for variations of a crime victim's name on Google from Dec. 1 through Jan. 7. Google would be required to provide Edina police with basic contact information for people targeted by the warrant, as well as Social Security numbers, account and payment information, and IP and MAC addresses. StarTribune reports: Information on the warrant first emerged through a blog post by public records researcher Tony Webster. Edina police declined to comment Thursday on the warrant, saying it is part of an ongoing investigation. Detective David Lindman outlined the case in his application for the search warrant: In early January, two account holders with SPIRE Credit Union reported to police that $28,500 had been stolen from a line of credit associated with one of their accounts, according to court documents. Edina investigators learned that the suspect or suspects provided the credit union with the account holder's name, date of birth and Social Security number. In addition, the suspect faxed a forged U.S. passport with a photo of someone who looked like the account holder but wasn't. Investigators ran an image search of the account holder's name on Google and found the photo used on the forged passport. Other search engines did not turn up the photo. According to the warrant application, Lindman said he had reason to believe the suspect used Google to find a picture of the person they believed to be the account holder. Larson signed off on the search warrant on Feb. 1. According to court documents, Lindman served it about 20 minutes later."decn45k,1488367222,beka13,ded35lr,That's pretty much the Republican playbook.

Does it really matter if the intelligentsia of the Party is divided, to the streetwalking Democrat voter who fears Trump? Is the fact that their party is ""divided"" going to make them stay home in close elections, or come out and vote in primary elections that are perceived to be a referendum on an establishment candidate?

Let's use the Paul Ryan primary election as a proxy: Paul Ryan is generally considered to be about as establishment Republican as they come; he is generally hated by the more extreme elements of the Republican Party. Ryan was facing a ""tough"" primary against a populist challenger - Paul Nehlen - during a time when the Republican Party was seen to be ""divided"" (late 2016,) and absolutely destroyed his challenger regardless. Political inertia, along with a lot of money, goes a long way in quelling populist outrage in Primary elections.

I don't think it's unreasonable to assume the supposed divisions in the Democratic Party will play out much the same; a bunch of sound and thunder is coming from an extreme wing of the Party but in reality it will probably not translate to political change. 

After watching the 2016 Democratic Primary as a bemused outsider, it is clear to me that *the moneyed interests and power players in the Democratic Party are totally in control of the Party.* *They do not necessarily listen to, or care about, the concerns of the more radical left Wing.* With that in mind, I doubt that the turmoil within the Party - to the extent that it exists in the first place - will amount to much in the 2018 elections.

I'm more interested to see if other Democrats will follow suit with Manchin in extending Donald Trump some decorum and working with the Administration to pass legislation.

We no longer see Ford plants with 100,000 workers, but increasingly specialized firms with lean staffing, or businesses with far-flung satellite offices across the globe. This presents a challenge for organizing, as solidarity between workers is hard to foster across work-sites, let alone continents.

Finally, the unions themselves bear some blame. Staid leadership and risk aversion has only exacerbated the trends working against organized labor, and there is an unwillingness to be bold among union bureaucrats. 

That doesn't mean unions are a dying breed though. As we look to the future, the old Communist idea of organizing the unemployed (or underemployed) might come to fruition, especially as the labor market polarizes further."deexhth,1488468312,everymananisland,deeyq0v,"&gt; I disagree, ad demand will be flat, nobody's going to run ads outside their district

It's kind of like when Bill Clinton met with Loretta Lynch at the airport or whatever -- if they actually scheming, they probably wouldn't do it in such a visible way.

At the same time, we're witnessing something that is absolutely incredible. In the first month of the new administration, one of Trump's closest advisers was caught lying to Trump's own Vice President about his communications with Russia. Consider how bizarre that is, especially in light of Russia's interference in the election. And now in the second month, the now Attorney General and another incredibly close Trump associate is caught in a very similar situation wherein he lied about communications with Russia. If these meetings are so routine, as Trump's team claims when they get caught lying about them, then why do they keep lying about them? 

I think it's increasingly obvious why Trump hates and attempts to delegitimize the media. He has plenty to hide, and serious investigative journalists are working furiously to turn over stones.

Imagine someone, while criticizing US involvement in WW2, saying ""Everyone thought Hitler was such a bad guy, but look at the Autobahn!"".  Context is important, and here the context is not in Bernie's favor.  

There's a somewhat thin line between pointing out good policies bad people had and advocating those policies, and merely using those policies to defend that person.  While Bernie does advocate those policies generally, it's pretty clear in this context he is using it to say Castro isn't as bad as we thought he was.

I heard on NPR this morning that R's are working / have already repealed a law that restricts gun purchases for people who are mentally ill.

People who have been adjudicated as mentally ill in a court or by a mental health professional are still prohibited from buying or owning firearms.

What was repealed was not a law restricting gun purchases for people who are mentally ill. It was an Obama issued rule that compelled the Social Security Administration to notify the FBI of people who receive social security benefits for some mental illness and have designated a representative payee to manage those benefits to add them to the list of people who are prohibited from owning firearms. The rule never had a chance to take effect so really nothing has changed.

If it came across that I was saying liberals *never* mock conservatives, then that was not my intention. Obviously they do. Both sides mock each other and to a large extent there's nothing wrong with that. 

But now we're in a situation where the worse offenders have convinced the lesser offenders that they are the true mean ones who need to take more responsibility and change. This is false, and gives false cover to conservatives' own efforts to dehumanize liberals. 

The problem is how successful this and other gaslighting strategies have been. Liberals are letting their self-deprecating and relativistic nature get to them by now essentially agreeing completely with conservatives that they have been too mean. This is also happening on other issues, such as the myth that democratic policies abandoned the working class (as opposed to the fact that democratic politicians have become increasingly boring and inarticulate in explaining their working class policies)."decoej2,1488390306,adidasbdd,dedjecg,"I was thinking the same thing.

I don't anticipate that the amount of automation is decreasing - I see that it have already decreased. I don't know why it have decreased, and I am deeply concerned that it will keep decreasing. 

Finding a way to increase it again will be the defining challenge of our time.

Once a reliable automated tractor gets put to market, you're going to watch the entire logistics and supply chain industry suddenly get rocked like the world was when Amazon blinked into existence. Any carrier that insists on requiring a human driver will be priced into obsolescence. Unless the company is also a moving company where the drivers also have to load and unload the shipment.

I firmly believe that the savings incurred by automating logistics will mean we see driverless tractor/trailers and trucks becoming mainstream well before we see driverless cars do the same.

These things get brought up on here, yes but in the public forum I don't see people making a thorough case. The counter argument, as you have pointed out, is pretty predictable but when you build an argument from the ground up (lower income people do not have jobs where they can take time off without penalty and they often work odd hours... DMVs are often few and far between and are not open on weekends... Some states have narrowed the hours that DMVs are open... Per capita, minorities make up a larger portion of people in the lower income bracket) When you build the case properly, you leave fewer avenues to justify voter ID laws as they are written. When the first thing out of your mouth is that Voter ID laws are racist the opposition argues that the text of the law applies equally to everyone and then they invoke the fraudulent voter boogyman. It puts you on the defensive right out of the gate.

I understand the sentiment but if you aren't willing to speak up and find an effective way to make you point the people overhearing the conversation inevitably are lost to the other side. The reason I specifically brought up voter ID laws is because at face value they seem like a good thing if you are a middle class American because you and everyone you know has an ID and from your perspective them seem easy enough to get. The argument against voter ID laws needs to be made in a clear manner so that people who are open minded and don't understand the problem with them aren't duped into believing that being against voter ID laws is a liberal conspiracy to rack up illegal votes."621e2o,1490727413,AutoModerator,dfiwz3i,"[A reminder for everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4479er/rules_explanations_and_reminders/).

This was how they were planning to ensure that people with pre-existing medical conditions could buy in at a lower rate, while ensuring premiums wouldn't go up across the board. 

The perspective as to why the ACA is 'failing' for conservatives is that premiums have been jumping up. The source of this is primarily that most young people found it is cheaper to pay the penalty than to buy health insurance.

&gt;From July through October in Florida â€” the four months when testing took place before Judge Scrivenâ€™s order â€” 2.6 percent of the stateâ€™s cash assistance applicants failed the drug test, or 108 of 4,086, according to the figures from the state obtained by the group. The most common reason was marijuana use. An additional 40 people canceled the tests without taking them. Because the Florida law requires that applicants who pass the test be reimbursed for the cost, an average of $30, the cost to the state was $118,140. 

[source that is against drug testing for welfare recipients] (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/us/no-savings-found-in-florida-welfare-drug-tests.html)

so 150 people were no longer on welfare due to the tests, if welfare (let's say for one year) was $800. they would have saved $120,000 a net of $2,000.

I highly doubt the welfare pays out less than 800 a year, (about 65 dollars a month).

It would be whataboutism if Obama actually did something McCarthyist.

Nowadays in order to get elected you need donors, and people to vote for you.  it is pretty hard to be elected with just one of those factors.


in theory because the official is no longer going to be incentivized by large donors, they would be forced to spend all of their energy on their constituents.  Officials would then be forced to not only show how they would vote on things, but why, and be able to articulate how they think about issues.  For the educated voter, you would have to implicitly trust them making decisions on your behalf.  Keep in mind all of this already happens, its just now you can verify if you are in agreement with their donors or not.

you may not be comfortable with trusting your elected official and hold them accountable, but isnt that the whole reason you have an elected official period?  Don't you think that is a problem with politicians that are in the current system, that they are not trustworthy to do the things they say they will do?  if you do not trust them to agree with you on important issues, why even bother with the system at all?


think of an example of this happening.  Say the senate is 50-50 split, and every member is publicly claiming to vote in a partisan manner.  If the vote ends up being not 50-50, the public would know someone lied (probably) within the losing parties caucus.  The internal fallout within the caucus would happen, and constituents from that party would be able to place blame on the whole party as opposed to any individual.  On the positive side of things, having them secretly vote would allow for the opposing party to more easily coax each other to form bipartisan alliances on issues/bills that they would otherwise not support out of fear of being primaried.

Yes, for 2016 that's correct.  However, the raw vote count isn't the primary metric... just the most glaring one.  Regardless, it is happening much more in recent history than in historical times.  The situation is worse at the local level in the state legislatures.  To know if we hare headed in a bad direction is to look at the trend.  For instance, the popular vote not matching the electoral college is now happening more frequent than historically.  2 times in the first 200 years, now 2 times just in the last 20.  Obviously, not a trend we want to continue - for EITHER party.  [I want to be clear that I'm not arguing that Democrats are being treated unfairly or that Republicans have rigged the system (although the gerrymandering does lie at their feet given how we select districts).  I'm just saying that if you look at the numbers the trends of proper representation are not good.]

So, this isn't one party over the other.  This is simply the math of votes and voters being matched by their representation.  So, even in 2016 the vote split was 49.1 to 48 as Wikipedia says... but the house seat split 55.4% to 44.6%. So, it doesn't take a raw vote imbalance to produce a representation imbalance.  That 11% seat discrepancy vs 1% vote difference is the largest in our history... so again, the trend is not good.

&gt; that the number of votes should determine the number of seats

Again, as shown above... the vote percentage should closely match the seat percentage.

Now it's difficult to have the percentage match 100% perfectly every time [you can't split humans in half for instance - at least not and have them still be able to vote... ;-) ].  But it has been shown that with FPTP along with gerrymandering you will see discrepancies like we are having.

Even if the majority cannot get 60 votes, all they have to do is *call* the bluff, and the minority would then *have* to go through the ridiculous 24/7 speech charade to stop the bill.

So why does the majority almost always fold instead? Because that's never to their advantage. It requires a LOT of manpower to stop, and it prevents *anything* else from happening. They can't vote on any other bills - healthcare, tax reform, budgets, etc. They decide it's not worth the fight, and it's better to move on to another topic instead.

Even though in your example the Civil Rights movement is most commonly associated with MLK Jr., there are other 'leaders' of the movement that are not as commonly associated, and their movements have had debatable success. Malcolm X comes to mind. There are examples of other political movements that did have a prominent leader that were not effective as well.

While I think your question is a fair one, I think the biggest factor for political movements being successful or effective is moreso a concrete objective. All of those examples of successful protests had concrete objectives: the right for African Americans to vote, to desegregate public schools, to remove the 'whites only' lunch counters and buses, etc. This point is somewhat arguable, but it wasn't clear to me what the exact objective or change movements like BLM or Occupy were going for. 

One other interesting effect of when you have a concrete objective defined is that you try and work within the system first to achieve your objective. The civil rights marches, or the Women's suffragist movement, erupted into protest because of grievances that our democratic framework was not working for them to achieve their goal, or that it actively worked against them.

You can find the price for any service a hospital offers with a phone call. Just demand they tell you the 'master charge' for a particular billing code.

Of course, you'll need to be a doctor in the specialty you plan to see to have a good idea of what services you might be billed for in the process of an visit. And if the doctor orders something else you get no say.

Also, the master charge is called the 'sheik list' because the prices are as close to infinity as possible to extract everything from anyone without insurance. If you have insurance you'll have to call your insurance and ask them what rate they've negotiated with your hospital for each service.

But keep in mind that the idea of the president of the United States colluding with our adversary, in this manner, is almost incomprehensible. This is different than Nixon allegedly working with North Vietnam to sabotage Johnson's peace talks, or Reagan working with Iran to delay the release of hostages.

Those are instances of Machiavellian, political quid pro quo. Unpleasant but not uncommon. Our current president *appears* to be a possible Manchurian candidate. Literally helping to implement the policy of a foreign government, apparently without regard for relative or absolute American gains. 

How exactly? Let's look at one case, the INF treaty signed by Reagan and Gorbachev. This is the only nuclear treaty to eliminate an entire class of ballistic missiles (short- and intermediate-range). Putin began to delevop new short range missiles under G.W. Bush. Bush rebuked him and reported the matter to Congress. Obama did the same thing, and also held an emergency meeeting of the INF signatories in Geneva. 

Putin deployed short range ballistic missiles last month in Volgograd, close and about equidistant to Russia's conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine. It's also public knowledge that limited use of tactical nuclear weapons to quickly crush conflict in non-nuclear states is part of their current defense doctrine. And, of course, Trump has said nothing. I don't believe he's tacitly approving the use of battlefield nuclear weapons, but I keep in mind that the phrase ""useful idiot"" comes from Russia. 

I mention this case to point out that looked at in the right light, it does indeed appear that the president is under the influence of a foreign country. 

Now, to answer your question about whether the FBI and CIA would be on to this- as I said, this state of affairs is inconceivable. The Constitution concedes that a president might be guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, or might lose his mind, but to be an asset of a foreign adversary is not even in the rule book. If it were true, that a veritable mole got through the door of the highest office in the land, it would be hideously, permanently debilitating for American prestige and credibility.

Most people with an economics background hear, ""Post-scarcity"" and think, well, there's always going to be a demand for something, so the idea of being beyond wanting something that not everyone can have is kinda silly.  Meanwhile, I think post-scarcity has gotten a connotation that means that we can provide for the basic needs of humanity.  

And this difference creates schisms when talking policy.  Because people use the idea that we're beyond scarcity to start talking implementing programs, like, UBI and as a way to promote the idea of automation.  When in reality, scarcity still very much exists and that there is just a redistributive method towards property.

What? The US didn't win WW1 for the allies. We certainly hastened that victory, but we didn't carry the war. Considering that the crippling parts of Versailles that helped lead to WW2 were imposed most heavily by France (and opposed by the US), I can't see any argument for US entry into WW1 causing WW2.

Not to mention that this ignores a lot of the secondary causes of WW2, particularly ideological and geopolitical competition between Germany and the USSR over Eastern Europe: US entry did nothing to cause the collapse of the Russian Empire and the ensuing civil war that lead to the creation of the communist USSR. Even if we presume that removing the US from WW1 would preclude the rise of fascism in Germany, the geopolitical competition for hegemony over Eastern Europe between Germany and the USSR would still be there, and still be a likely catalyst for WW2. There's also the East Asian conflicts, like the Sino-Japanese War, that were also part of WW2, where there's no way to paint a connection between US entry into WW1 and their existence.

You can spin the Google and see how bad they've worked out for yourself, but here are two examples: Louisiana, [where kids enrolled in private schools test scores plummeted](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-02-22/research-louisianas-school-voucher-program-harms-student-performance), and Wisconsin, [where almost *all* of the schools in their voucher programs are religious](https://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/28741-religion-permeates-wisconsin-voucher-system) to the point where some Catholic parishes receive more money from taxpayers than parishioners. The majority of WI students in voucher programs [were already enrolled in private, religious school](https://ffrf.org/outreach/item/18925-catholic-schools-win-big-in-wisconsin-voucher-scheme), so the idea that there is some ""choice"" being made by parents in failing public schools is ridiculous. 

I can see how Charter Schools can work, but they have to be non-profit (no pass-through to a management company) and well-regulated so they don't cherry pick students and leave more challenging learners behind. That's not the way it's been in MI, DeVoss' home state, and [their education progress shows it.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/betsy-devos-michigan-school-experiment-232399)

I am also no fan of Obama's Race to the Top or NCLB/ESSA, the latter being unfunded mandates that have strapped public schools for cash. The general pattern, by Republicans and some Democrats, has been to starve public schools of funding then throw up their hands and yell ""the sky is falling"" and call for drastic solutions that eliminate public schools. The price of education doesn't exist in a vacuum - schools have facility, energy and technology costs that increase just like they do in the private sector, but somehow that gets left out of the arguments about ""greedy teachers' unions"". 

If either party would take aim at consultants and standardized testing companies, that would be a breath of freaking fresh air. [Look at this bullshit from my state](http://www.nbcdfw.com/investigations/90-Million-Tab-for-STAAR-Testing-Includes-Pricey-Meetings-Travel-Consultants-201520411.html) - $90 *million dollars* spent in one year for STAAR test preparation as part of a $500,000,000 five year contract. After all that money was spent with Pearson, they turned over testing to ETS for $280,000,000 and they fucked up by losing entire schools' test scores so that year the STAAR just didn't count. My kid wasted a whole bunch of class time and TX wasted hundreds of millions of dollars that would have been better put to use in the classroom."dedgxpy,1488404762,DeeJayGeezus,dedx3h0,"&gt; and be mimicked by worse-performing states.

That case is more subtle to make, and Trump can protect himself by firing anyone who gets directly implicated (e.g. Flynn) as clean-up.  And such clean-up is not entirely cosmetic: to the extent that Trump is now surrounded by fewer Russian puppets our democracy is actually a little safer."dewwh9v,1489515293,philssister,dexa44r,"Do you think that if term limits were a concern, more people would step up to fill seats?

If it undeniably gave more power to lobbyists then they would show support for term limits.  Yet they show little support for the groups and politicians that advocate for term limits.  They seem to value more their long term connections and investments in politicians.

I've seen the studies too and the results vary heavily depending on the size and type of legislature.  It's very difficult to generalize across all states about their effect.  A small population state might not fare as well as the larger population ones.  Also, term limits undoubtedly cause some chaos when first implemented but the legislature will adapt in time.  Be careful that the studies you read don't capitalize on those issues to influence their conclusion.

I don't think term limits should be dismissed so easily out of hand.   Term limits most obvious effect is on turnover and we currently have a major stagnation issue as Congress has a +95% incumbency re-election rate.  Given how term limit preform in large population states I find myself supporting them on the federal level.

Mattis is good at his job and realizes that telling Muslims ""yeppers, being a good Muslim is alll about terrorism"" is a terrible idea, and that splitting terrorists off from the rest of Muslims is good strategy.  Republicans still haven't figured this out yet, and are obsessed with using ""Muslim"" ""Islamic"" and ""Sharia Law"" to tie terrorists to the Muslim faith as closely as possible.  It's PC because they will crucify you unless you use the specific words they want.

2.  The obsession with feigned respect for the military.  It's not real respect - it doesn't apply to veterans who got tortured - they'll crucify you on whether you *look* like you're paying lip service to military / police, not whether your policies are actually good for them.
