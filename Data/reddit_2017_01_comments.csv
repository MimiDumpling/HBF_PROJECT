## And some handicapping ##

In 2017, Democrats should win in New Jersey, and probably have a slight edge to hold Virginia.

In 2018, the big crop of ""Tea Party"" governors will largely hit their term limits. It seems unlikely that none of those states would flip to the Democrats. I'd pick out Nevada, New Mexico and Florida as the strongest possibilities, but as always a lot depends on candidates.

If the GOP is going to win any more governorships, New York, Minnesota, and Colorado would be their best pickup opportunities. There's only 10 Dem governorships up, and half of them seem safe.

My prediction is GOP loses 3 governor's mansions in 2017 and 2018, on net.

Wrong. We use that whenever another democrat comes out with a hateful race baiting line about how ""-ist"" people in this country are and how the tactics used by people like Waters and Lewis are right in line with what caused the Dems to lose over 1000 state and federal elected positions in the 2016 election year. 

&gt;What did Trump learn from Obama?

Exactly what not to do.

&gt;At some point we need to decide what really lost the election because if Hillary was the problem then with her not there anymore it shouldn't be an issue. If it is something else we need specifics not just ""out of touch"".

Elitism, the moral superiority complex, the hate, the bigotry, the racism, the lack of meaningful action. The only people voting democrat anymore have it so good or are so indoctrinated they don't even think for themselves. The Democrats lost for a very complex and all-encompassing list of reasons that this thread is not going to address in any adequate measure. And it's about time. I can't believe anyone would vote for them in the first place. Well, I can, but only because I know that the people who do are literally the most out of touch with the nation. Go live in a small town in literally any state and see if people really do fit the narrative pushed by the MSM and the democrats. They don't. I've seen more hate and racism from the left this last year than I have in the entirety of my life before that, and I happen to be from a small town in west texas many would assume is full of racists.

&gt;You are right though, IF Trump does a great job he will get elected again, but I don't understand your connection between that and how Democrats are acting. IF Trump is so great then the Democrats can kiss his boot and still lose because he is being such a good president so what does it matter?

The connection lies in the desire for bipartisanship. I am socially liberal, but the connection to the left ends beyond gay marriage and women's right to choose. Other than that, the democrats are frankly inefficient, stupid and hypocritical. I hope they wise up, but they won't. They are too far gone. They rigged their own primaries so badly that Hillary should have worn a nascar jacket to rallies to show who she really cares about. I guarantee it wasn't any ordinary Americans. I sincerely hope that changes because if they wise up, it can only benefit the nation. As an American, all I care about are other Americans and our nation's prosperity and safety. The democrats promised everything except those two things. 

&gt;However, if Trump fails then you think people will say, ""Well Trump screwed me over, but since the Democrats were mean let's vote him in again.""

That isn't what I think. I think Trump will do a pretty good job, but if he doesn't, he deserves to lose.

&gt;Let's be honest here, we know that Democrats acting this way won't hurt them with anyone who planned to vote for them anyways.

Eventually it will because that behavior is exactly why they lost and for anyone who wants liberalism to be a top contender again, then they will have to rebuild the party, the platform and the grass-roots organization from the ground up again. The establishment will collapse, kind of already has, and true representatives will assume the helm of the Democratic party.

Trump has made it clear that he wants to radically change American foreign policy, and while it remains to be seen if he has the skill or support needed to do so, one of the keys of that change is distancing American involvement in NATO.

In rhetoric, this seems like a huge shift, but in practice its actually pretty consistent with the shifting nature of the US/Western European relationship since 2008, really since the end of the Cold War if you're inclined to make such an argument. In 2008 a reason for the alliance's being was tested in the American and European response to the Russian invasion of Georgia. European leaders largely split with America in condemning Russian action in the region. Opposition to Russian aggression in and around Europe was one of the primary reasons the alliance was founded, and in 2008 there was a clear shift in European priorities away from that opposition. Even when the threat was more clear, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Europe largely dragged their feat on sanctions due in part to economic interests in Russia, and perhaps due to the fact that there are now a few more countries between the European heartland (German, France, and the Low Countries) and Russia. Thus the US has largely leaned on the Polish-led Visegrad Group to offer a credible threat against the Russians, helped by American money, planes, training, and troops. 

NATO does little to benefit US interests anymore, and US foreign policy has largely come to terms with that already, Trump is just the first President to be outwardly dismissive or even hostile to the alliance. This is partly a nativist impulse to drum up support from his base (which he needs given his shaky position with Congressional Republicans), but its also to differentiate himself from the Obama Administration which outwardly looked to favor institutions like NATO, despite largely avoiding them when dealing with threats to the United States (unless they took the lead first like in Libya).

The truth is Trump's foreign policy will be, in practice, virtually identical to Obama's, much as Obama's was virtually identical to Bush's. In appearance it will be very different, antagonistic to the Europeans and Chinese, and more conciliatory to the Russians and the Turks. The US is finally discovering a new paradigm for foreign policy following the end of the first Cold War: Balance of Power. In essence its not really a new paradigm, just a new version of one used by the British during their time as the dominant power. The US is going to be a little less antagonistic to our enemies, and a little more distant to our friends all in the pursuit of playing regional powers off of eachother to limit American involvement in conflicts that are not a direct threat to the United States. This will strain relations with Europe, but the US can afford to strain relations with Europe. 

Trump will be hated for the perceived crises he will create, but mark my words: his successor will embrace this new paradigm in foreign policy.

NOTE: I voted against Trump, don't think he's a good person or remotely qualified to lead this country, and would rather Hillary Clinton or almost anyone else be President. BUT I do think Trump may be a useful idiot with regard to America's transition to this new foreign policy paradigm.

No, I just really don't want every nation with a modem to come digitally teabag us every 4 years.

The logic seems to be in the same vein as - ""My friend died and left me this book. I enjoy reading the book. Therefore I must be glad my friend died. Thank god that asshole is dead.""

No national sovereignty and immigration laws don't conflict personal liberty. Abortion is not something libertarians agree on. There is a strong divide. For those who disagree (like me) it's because we believe the child is an individual and has a right to life.

Also libertarianism will die if we allowed millions of people who believe in large government entitlements to cross our border, become citizens, and then subsequently vote for democrats who'll increase the government and absolutely eliminate the chance of libertarian policies passing.

It's pointless to ask how to get a third party to win if you don't first figure out why we have two parties to begin with.  The reason is fairly complex, but what it essentially boils down to is that our system is structurally, although not intentionally, biased towards a system wherein politicians coalesce into two groups.  If a politician wishes to compete and effect change, then aligning one's self to one of the two major parties is the only way to do it.  Even if one does manage to run and win as a third party or independent, they still have to effectively operate as a member of one of those parties regardless of how they were elected (e.g., Bernie Sanders is elected as an independent, but functions as any Democrat would as a member of their caucus).

Third parties exist in other nations, particularly in parliamentary ones, because the system has a loophole that can favor third parties.  Most voters still coalesce into two major parties, but it's possible for third parties to siphon enough votes to prevent either major party from gaining a majority of seats.  If that happens, one or more third parties can offer to ally themselves with one of the major parties and form a coalition, which affords the third party politicians an over-sized influence compared to their actual vote share.

We would need a systematic, structural change to our republican institutions in order for third parties to become viable.

As I mentioned, security underpins prosperity. Security on the continent for the last 70 years has been accomplished by binding together first the west and center, and later the south and east, into a strong alliance dedicated to collective security and cemented by American military power. The last bit is important. There have been numerous prior attempts to create a system to prevent aggression and conflict. None were guaranteed by the overarching power of an outside actor and relied on the good faith of the European powers themselves. None lasted more than a couple of decades.

So it's not about the United States acting as Europe's policeman. It's about the MEANINGFUL guarantee of collective security.

The mistake a lot of people make I think is they see the effects of the alliance (peace, prosperity, cooperation) and assume that those effects are a sort of default state that would persist if you removed their foundation, when the reality is the opposite.

And the reason this concerns the United States is because the world is a different place than it was 150 years ago. Everything is connected. It's not even relevant to try to rank or quantify American trade with Europe as opposed to other countries. Political and economic events have ripple effects that cannot be contained.

""Felt"" being the key phrase there. The Tea Party was not a nuanced examination of policy to determine what led to the financial problems of the country: it was an angry reaction to Democrat's victory that doubled down on conservative ideology and purged anyone who didn't meet their purity test. If you think that the new Republicans actually care about fiscal conservative values, just look at how they reacted to ideas like reducing military spending or increasing taxes on the rich.

I actually stated in another comment that I wouldn't be surprised if we have a messy Civil War in the style of the Spanish Civil War where the war wasn't fought between different sides of the country but between the cities and the rural areas with the suburbs being caught in the middle.

The thing is I think the racial tensions are somewhat the result of the increasing cultural divide between rural and urban areas. Rural whites and urban minorities are already divided just on ethnicity. The geographical barriers that separate these two groups further limit contact and understanding. The same thing can be seen between urban whites and rural whites. There are exceptions to everything, but the trend is clear in the voting records and the polls.

If anything, this election taught us that identity politics cannot win future elections.

Yes, Republicans won by focusing on the white vote.

Yes, Republicans (mostly Trump) courted white nationalists.

However, **the Republicans did not win the white vote by courting white nationalists.**

**They won the white vote by focusing on rural issues** such as the rural decay, loss of manufacturing jobs, etc. These used to be Democratic issues and just 4-8 years before they were. Remember, a large number of Obama voters in the Midwest voted for Trump. These people are not racist. They are/were white blue-collar workers who were often unionized. White blue collar workers do tend to be socially conservative, but that's not the issue they vote on. They vote for manufacturing and Clinton woefully failed to heed to their concerns.

She kept up the identity politics strategy trying to appeal to Latinos and moderate suburbs by always pointing out how ""deplorable"" Trump was. There's nothing wrong with that, but that was literally her entire strategy. She neglected the Midwest and the rural issues and it costed the Presidency.

Indeed, people are more anxious about racial relations now than in a long time, but this issue seems to be masking the real issue at hand which is the increasing fundamental political divide between rural and urban areas. Racial groups can reconcile through communication and periods of prosperity. Rural and urban areas, on the other hand, are fundamentally divided on the issues that matter most to them:

* **Trade:** Cities thrive on free trade due to cheap goods and services as well as global markets for their goods and services whereas rural areas thrive on protectionism because it protects their agricultural and manufactured goods from global pricing.
* **Borders:** Cities thrive on open borders because it allows tourism and flow of skilled workers whereas rural areas thrive on closed borders because it protects workers from low wages.
* **Social government services:** Government services tend to be less effective in rural areas than in urban areas because rural areas are more spread out, requiring a larger investment for less people. That's why rural residents tend to be so ""anti-government"". They rarely benefit from government services besides Medicare despite paying taxes for them.

There is a divide on cultural and social grounds, but I feel these are very psychological manifestations of the real economic, geopolitical issues listed above."dcudm9y,1485279887,ThreeBetRage,dcukrmq,"OPM is a primary source.

I think you are underplaying what bigotry is. Bigotry is a deep seeded principle throughout America but it's not called bigotry, it hides under things like ""smart"", ""winning"", ""justice"", ""patriotism"", ""nationalism"", ""self-made man"", etc.

Trump said that evading taxes made him smart. His voters cheered him. That's where America is right now. If you can win, even if it forces others to lose, you are smart. The taxes that Trump evaded fallback on the taxpayer but his voters did not care. Even some of the left was applauding him. That's what America calls ""smart."" If you can get away with it and you benefit, you get the thumbs up, no matter the consequences. That is oppression. We don't call it oppression but that is one mechanism which allows oppression to thrive.

Even when talking to a lot Trump voters, they will admit that he is kind of an asshole. One specifically told me ""yeah, Trump is a player that's why I like him."" What they may or may not realize they are saying is that Trump is playing a game where he wins and someone else gets hurt. They don't care that someone else loses because he won. They admire that. They admire the ""winning!"" quality in Trump because they don't care about the losers. They admire that Trump squashes everyone in his path. That is bigotry. 

Americans do not search for solutions, they search for an advantage. ""Competition"" used to mean strive together to progress, but it has turned into beating up the other so you can win. 

Obviously the world is not kumbaya. There's a practical side of things where you are going to have to fight against rather than work together. Where winning so that the other loses is going to have to happen. But it has long been twisted into normalized bigotry. Trump is the epitome of that. That is why Trump voters are rightfully declared bigoted. They didn't vote for solutions, they voted to ""win.""

&gt;The majority of them are concerned with their well-being and the future

But in a manner that is harmful to the other. 

They are not willing to fight for fairness. They don't want a fair system. They want unfairness in their favor. They want the other to lose. Trump said ""you will be winning so much, you'll get tired of it!"" That's the highlight of his campaign. Make the others lose. 

This is a major theme that's always been around in politics. The right constantly fight to keep certain factions advantaged. It is a white rich man's country. It's not new. What Trump did was dumb it down a lot and play to the idiocracy. Bigotry is a major theme every election, Trumpers are just more obvious in their bigotry. 

&gt; Trump is unique, and appeals to people that want to try something new.

The right has always voted for an unfair advantage. Trump is the epitome of who they want to be, they just didn't want to be so outspoken about it until now. How many conservatives do you really think wouldn't skimp out on taxes if they could get away with it? They all want to be the big powerful ""businessman."" 

The only thing unique about Trump was that he united the factions of the right. He tricked all of them into thinking he's on their side through his bigoted rhetoric. Each one of them. The poor think he's going to fight for them. The rich think he's going to help them maintain their riches.

The standard is the same for all companies.  It applies to all.  Not every company has the ability to turn a profit.  Not every company has the ability to meet customer demands.  If a company can't meet a standard, then they probably have poor management, structure, or product.  This isn't the regulations fault.

&gt; Wait, so the government saying that you must comply with a standard is the market picking a winner???

If the standard applies to the entire market, and specific companies can't meet the standard...YES!!!!  Absolutely.  If a company can't meet the standard, they probably don't have the cash flow, or profit margin, to update their systems.  From a market standpoint, they are inefficient compared to their peers.  If they were a better company, they would have the ability to meet the standards, like the better companies can.  

Though you are twisting my words.  I said the market chose to abandon coal.  I was specifically commenting to your statement about coal.  Simply, coal is about $4/mmbtu shipped.  Nat gas, here, is about $2.50/mmbtu delivered.  Forget the regulation.

You're a business.  What would you choose to burn.  Remember, you have to store coal in piles (that can spontaneously combust), have belts to deliver from pile to service, pulverize it, have heavy equipment for the piles and operators for equipment, etc...  Gas is a utility line coming straight into ignition.  Again, pick one.  Forget the regulations.  What's the best choice for you?

Edit: a government picking winners and losers is where a company can't meet a standard so the government gives them money, or a pass from the standard, to prop them up in the name of jobs (true or false).  This happens often.  Corporate welfare is a thing and it picks winners and losers.  Creating standards to operate by doesn't, provided they are fair and apply evenly."5mjl7x,1483838057,wstsdr,dc50nd0,"They failed so take into account just how stupid Americans really are.

Or bad?5q973b,1485464089,kfun123,dcy5zx5,"Here is my take:


+  Repealing Obamacare provisions, Ind / Emp mandate, community rating restrictions, rate review, Essential Health Benefits, Medical loss ratios, other mandates
     +  Removing the mandate is going to kill the individual market, if we couldn't get a actuarially sound Ind market with mandates it certainly isn't going to happen without them.

     +  Removing Community rating means that old people can now be charged 5 times the base rate instead of 3, so good luck affording coverage if you are between 55 and 65 years old.

     +  Removing rate review seems to allow the insurers to charge whatever they want with no review, say hello to more huge rate increases.

     +  Removal of ESB, while this might bring back some catastrophic plans which served a real need in the market, it is also going to let mini-med garbage plans back in.

     +  Removing the medical loss ratio requirements is a great way to make insurance more expensive and again paves the way for garbage plans with low medical loss ratios (40 to 60% instead of 80%+)

+  Pre-Existing Conditions
     +  Only protects those with pre-existing conditions for 2 years and only applies to the group market, so you are screwed if you need an individual plan.

+  Equalized Tax Treatment
     +  While it does put us on a balanced playing field for group vs individual coverage it gives a huge tax advantage to those in the high tax brackets.

+  Expansion of HSA
     + While some of this stuff is good like the OTC &amp; premium usage changes, the removal of the max contrib limit is a huge give away to the rich. HSA accounts are the only triple-tax advantaged accounts out there. Allowing unlimited contributions is basically an unlimited 401k with the ability to have any money spent out of the account on healthcare be untaxed also. It is a huge boon to those in the top income brackets, also the changes to roll-over rules make it a great way to avoid estate taxes.

+  Charity Care Bad Debt Reduction
     +  Physicians give out charity care today without this provision, now maybe they will increase charity care, but it again seems like a give away to those with high income for doing something they are already doing now.

+  Pool reform in Ind Market
     +  Since churches, trade associations, civic groups, etc.. can already provide insurance I am not sure what the impact of this provision is.

+  Interstate Market for Health Insurance
     +  While it gives some allowance for secondary state insurance regulation this seems to open the door for a race to the bottom in regulation, similar to credit cards. Although it is difficult to assess the full impact without the exact provisions of the law.

+  Associated Health Plans
     +  While AHPs exist today this makes them easier to establish, again without the provisions of the law it is difficult to assess the impact here.

+ Anti-Trust Reform
     +  Again need to see the full language, but this could be quite problematic from a price fixing perspective, especially with joint ownership of healthcare providers like United Insurance buying Surgical Care Associates.

+  Medicaid Waivers
     + Could be a good thing to allow states more flexibility, but the cynic in me sees this as an avenue to restrict Medicaid enrollment / services at the state level.

+  Self-Insurance Protections
     +  In the early days of the ACA switching to a self-funded / self-insured plan with stop-loss insurance was seen as a potential backdoor out of ACA requirements for small to mid sized employers. The federal gov issue rules that clamped down on these types of efforts. This seems to reverse those federal rules, but I am not sure of the actual impact since they are gutting most of the rules that small / mid sized groups didn't want to comply with.

I lived abroad in Brazil for two years, so I had to deal with this from the other end myself. I learned Portuguese, I didn't talk bad about Brazilian foods (which I honestly found kind of bland), I tried to get into soccer, and respected the fact that social customs surrounding families, time management, communities, and so on, were different from what they were in the US. I think that it's common courtesy when you go somewhere else to respect the customs and culture of that place when trying to replace it with your own. And while immigrant communities have often been better at doing this than conservatives might admit, the temptation of rejecting the culture around you and forming an ethnic enclave is always present (just as it is with American expat communities elsewhere), and denying this danger does liberals no favors.

So while I don't believe this desire to preserve culture is in itself sinister or racist, it can be twisted in racist ways. One of these ways is denying that our culture is already multicultural to a certain extent. As a white Southerner, many of the things I love â€“ cornbread, college football, Outkast â€“ are blacker than they are white. Another way is by using this ""cultural preservation"" idea as a way to attack people rather than a way to let them in. Look at [this article](http://theweek.com/articles/639279/bill-clintons-secret-message-whites) about Bill Clinton, specifically the third quote. It's effective because it doesn't presume that newcomers are refusing to assimilate, but it still promotes American values like work and freedom and exhorts immigrants to embrace these values instead of putting the onus on those who are already here. (I imagine the dynamic is similar in the military, which is why the military has been successful in getting people from disparate backgrounds to work together.) This, I think, is the division between the cultural nationalists who are concealed racists and those who have a healthy concern for their communities: are they saying these things with the presumption that immigrants aren't meeting them, or are they saying them in the hope that immigrants will rise up to the challenge?"dc9xtqf,1484114207,[deleted],dc9ynlz,[removed]dcndhk3,1484900867,chreis,dcnykbz,"Also, your data is wrong.

In my old employer-provided plan, I could go to my doctor or an urgent care or whatever. $10 copay here, $10 copay there. Migraines? Stomach flu? Physical injuries? $10 to treat. No matter what my doctor does. X-rays, blood tests. It's all good. Just $10 to me and the rest to my insurance. But should I hit a telephone pole head-on at 60mph and enter a 2-week coma? My insurance will cover around $20,000 and tell me ""good luck"" with the rest. I enter bankruptcy and become clinically depressed.

ACA banned this plan. 

Now, my employer plan gives me enormous deductibles. Got a migraine? I can go to my doctor, but I'll pay him the entire retail price of the visit (hundreds of dollars). Wipe out on a bicycle? Go to urgent care. Pay retail. An outbreak of pneumonia? Hope you have hundreds of dollars to pay the doctor. Insurance won't even touch it. Then I wonder ""wait, why do I have insurance again?"" ... If I manage to have an extraordinary amount of these incidents in one year, I'll finally start getting *some* co-insurance coverage. But... if I slam into a telephone pole and nearly die and rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospital bills, my personal out of pocket will only be several thousand. I won't have to enter bankruptcy (though to some people, this in fact could still send them down that path, since the deductible is so sky high).

My other option is private insurance that I buy myself. Thanks To ACA, the only reason I'd do this is to have both worlds above. The cheap everyday visits AND the catastrophic coverage. Except, it's that second part that is monstrously expensive, so I'm looking at $400/month for coverage. Since I don't qualify for any kind of subsidy.

I guess there are arguments either way, but I rather liked the peace of mind of cheap, everyday, preventative medicine instead of the forced enormous-deductible, only-worth-it-if-you-have-a-million-to-one-accident policies that Obama has force-fed through the system.

Foreign nations hold significant sums of our dollars in the form of bonds (Japan and China both hold over $1 trillion) which ties them to us. 

Even if/when China surpasses us in GDP (it should be mentioned that their GDP per capital lags far behind), other nations still view their economy as volatile and their future uncertain not least because they are not a democracy (and also prop up their financial indicators).

Donald Trump can do much to erode that confidence in the American economy such as combatting the Fed, instituting tariffs, deregulating trading, and the like but you can expect push back from industries that keep him in check. Remember that George W Bush helped precipitate the Great Recession by pushing home ownership on families that couldn't even afford the mortgage premiums! Although Trump will inevitably hurt how the US is viewed or even initiate another recession, the US will be able to continue its leadership for generations to come as long as we can recognize our mistakes and put someone next in office willing to spend political capital to fix the mistakes of his/her predecessor (such as Obama bailing out the banks and GM).

It's important to remember what knocked off Britain, France, and Germany - WWI and WWII decimated the European continent and allowed the US - which emerged with its industry and manufacturing intact - to move into those markets and maintained its global presence from the end of the war to establish a new world order.

Let me tell you one of the incredible wasteful things the British government does.  I have a friend.  He's a Brit who moved to the U.S. when he was 18.  He's a U.S. Citizen.  Very successful.  Retired now.  Worth millions.

The UK government called him one day to inform him he was still eligible for a government pension.  (I forget how much.)  Guess it's like the UK's social security.  Anyhow, he doesn't need it and hasn't lived in the UK since he was 18.  The government told him he could either have a one-time cash payment or, for $50, he could get a check every month for the rest of his life.  He took the latter and has no doubt gotten way more money than he ever paid in taxes.

But wait, it gets better.  His wife, who is American, is also eligible.  She gets the monthly check too!  She has NEVER been a UK resident.  By dint of her marriage, she gets the money.

Whatever the rules are for this program, they need to be changed.  The UK is literally paying people for no reason.

As for training, there are jobs that need no training.  Sweeping the floors in a warehouse doesn't need training, it's necessary, but the labor isn't worth minimum wage.  That's the kind of job a kid could take while they are learning the shipping business.  And when it comes time to hire an entry level shipper, they'll hire the kid since he's been around the warehouse for months and at least sees how it works.  Training often comes just by being there every day and watching other people do the job.  That doesn't work for all jobs, but for many basic jobs, the sort of jobs that minimum wage is supposed to help.

By foisting a minimum wage on businesses, they cannot spend that money on a kid that sweeps up.  It's a loss.  You're asking a business to take a loss.  They're not charities.  They'll never do that.  It's like demanding that fish start breathing water."dci9f5t,1484596417,[deleted],dcicovl,"except it clearly does need to change.

Asking ""when will the jobs come back to the US?"" That's meaningless, the jobs haven't left the US, we've currently got full employment. The jobs have changed.

&gt; From opinion data alone, it is possible to estimate when a change occurred. This can test between alternative explanations, which include not only the Comey letter (October 28th) but preceding events such as the announcement a hike in Affordable Care Act premiums (October 24th).

&gt;What specifically do you mean by this?

What I meant was that Trump is revoking the capacity of individuals in the federal government who study and report on anthropogenic climate change 

&gt;An almost certainly temporary gag rule is not ""neutering"" anything.

If he is keeping individuals from reporting on his activities while restructuring the agencies to agree with him, while being at odds with almost universally accepted science, that is neutering them

&gt;&gt;and is restructuring them to match his agenda.

&gt;This is the norm for every single Presidency. 

Yes, but never to the extent of this transition or at this velocity,

&gt;&gt;In other words, Trump is simultaneously **destroying** the long term survival of America by ignoring the threat of climate change, 

&gt;I added a word in bold I assumed you dropped off. 

I meant to put ""threatening"", I felt ""destroying"" would be too drastic, but for my argument, either one works 

&gt;Trump putting a temporary gag order on the EPA will not destroy America's long term survivability. 

&gt;His policies and purported refusal to accept Climate Change will certainly have some impact, but I also doubt they will singlehandedly destroy America's long term survivability. 

&gt;They will certainly damage it, however, or contribute along side many other things to its destruction.  

I'm in the field of conservation biology and I consider myself to be an ardent environmentalist, so I am undoubtedly biased, but I do believe that Trump reducing America's ability to combat anthropocentric climate change do indeed pose a significant threat to the long term survivability of our Republic

&gt;He is not setting any sort of precedent for silencing dissenters by his actions here. 

Please explain to me how taking away the ability of individuals working for federal agencies to report on climate change (considering he not only doubts its existence, but is also moving ahead with initiatives that are at odds with combating climate change, such as approving the Keystone XL pipeline) is not silencing dissenters 

&gt;&gt;I try to avoid being an alarmist, but I cannot find anyway to be optimistic about this.

&gt;Well, I don't agree with Trump on climate change, and it seems you don't either. 

&gt;So there is no need to be optimistic about that.

The only thing that would win you this conversation is him reversing his position and becoming indifferent to race, which he didn't. Giving non-whites in your political union equal rights (at a contentious time when doing so would help unify the state) doesn't make you not racist. The right wing is full of white nationalists who think black people should be able to vote (see: Jared Taylor). As the left is fond of pointing out, the internet is flush with racist libertarians, who are fine with equal rights for minorities within the nation so long as their number is carefully limited by immigration policy.

The point was the dude was racist AF, as was much of the west at the time. The context for this is the previous comment jumping to the ""racism == Nazism"" line. The obvious response to this is as I said: The enemies of Nazism were racist too. Maybe De Gaulle had a total reversal of opinion later in life, and would be [totally chill ](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine) with a France that was 88% black. I doubt it, and I think you doubt it too. I think you know darn well that the leaders and generation that beat the Nazis, at least at the time they did so, envisioned a white future for their countries.

If you could time-warp De Gaulle, or Churchill, or any random white person from the period and ask them ""are you indifferent to whites being a minority in 2042?"" they would almost certainly say ""no"", and quite strongly. This is the central point, one you know you can't dispute, which is why we are having this irksome side argument about a later French political compromise, as if anything you say on the incident would change the lens through which we view the West of the 1940s.

The reason this point is made at all is because the left has a strong urge to retcon historical events to be part of their grand story. People today are strongly primed to dislike the Nazis. Appropriating this dislike is useful to modern political movements, and they do so by pretending that past historical conflicts were really all about their pet issue, creating negative associations with policies they have trouble arguing against on the merits with low-info types who don't already share their values. The form this takes on the left, as we see above, is conditioning their footsoldiers to repeat banal talking points like ""having a pro-white immigration policy is a *Nazi* idea"" as if just about every nation-state of the era wasn't also defined by some ethnic/religious identity expressed in immigration policy. This rhetoric is every bit as asinine as the right's less-frequently-seen version of same, which is trying to slander single-payer healthcare or national infrastructure projects as ""Nazi ideas"", along with ""Obama is Hitler"" comparisons.

The people who opposed the Nazis, De Gaulle included, were mostly racist, and also shared those ""Nazi tenets"" with respect to immigration policy.

They rely on a belief in intangible absolutes, which are, for all intents and purposes, religious in nature. 

No. Deontological frameworks are often religious in nature, but they so not have to be, since they are concerned with rules rather than outcomes. Good examples of secular deontological ethics are honor codes (I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do) or professional codes of conduct such as the AICPA's (CPAs act with integrity, objectivity, due care, competence, etc).

&gt;I'm curious about what 'pragmatic' ethics in government would entail, though. I understand their utility in examining historical action through the lens of their own time, but how do you write policy based on such a concept?

Pragmatic ethics can be useful for policymaking in areas where scientific advancement is expected. The viability test in *Roe v. Wade* is something akin to pragmatic ethics (28 weeks, but maybe 24 weeks in some cases is determined to be the viability pont, at which the compelling state interest in protecting life controls).

&gt;I set it aside specifically to avoid derailing the conversation; bodily autonomy is a can of worms that will take over the discussion.

Sure. It's not actually ""bodily autonomy"" that I was trying to discuss, but rather using it as an example of where differing moral values affect ethical frameworks even within the same overall type of ethics.

&gt;An appeal to our historical roots doesn't make something ethical today, though. 

That's the point of this discussion - ethics are not objective, they are subjective based on underlying moral judgments and the philosophical structures that support the frameworks developed. 

&gt;If we are to govern in a secular manner, the only measure of a policy can be through the effects.

This is a tariff on certain domestic companies. We're not placing a tariff on foreign cars/automobiles. Countries can't retaliate against this tariff since it only affects domestic companies that outsource.

I actually am pro-choice, but I have to clarify this.  

There are [650 Planned Parenthood centers](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-at-a-glance), and they do an average of more than [300,000 abortions per year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/12/for-planned-parenthood-abortion-stats-3-percent-and-94-percent-are-both-misleading/?utm_term=.fbb3866a72d9).  The number is higher but the math is easier with 300,000.  Which averages to 451 abortions per site per year, or more than one per site per day.   

Now they claim that of the 10 million activities they do per year, [34%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/12/for-planned-parenthood-abortion-stats-3-percent-and-94-percent-are-both-misleading/?utm_term=.fbb3866a72d9) are contraceptive related (ranging from full prescription for birth control to renewal of script to handing out a single condom to one person).   But still, average is higher than one per site per day.

&gt;If you had a separate building (extra rent and utilities) with a redundant staff (someone has to work at the abortions only facility) redundant equipment (they need tools to work) you have just bloated PP's operating costs and whatever money might be received for abortion services would not be able to sustain the operating costs.

Gingrich led Republicans into huge congressional victories by co-opting parts of Perovian anti-establishment rhetoric. The Contract with America was an attempt to motivate the Perot voters to join, or at least cast a ballot for, the Republican Party. It's where the idea of the 'missing white voters' comes from.

Those Republicans who entered Congress helped the GOP become what we thought it was 2 years ago. Rick Santorum, Joe Scarborough, George Pataki, Lindsey Graham, Gary Johnson, Bob Barr, Richard Burr, Sam Brownback, and, of course, George W. Bush all got their break following Republican efforts to annex Perot's movement.

It's often said that Goldwater won the 1964 election, it just took 16 years to count the vote. In that same idea, Perot won the 1992 election, 24 years later. Trump got into politics with the Reform Party, and used a lot of rhetoric Perot probably recognised to get into office. (Plus a bit of Buchananite nationalism and anger) His last stand at Gettysburg was a speech straight out of 1992. Trump rallied the Perot voters to his side, and now we might be about to see some deep voodoo."dcotdc0,1484949596,DestroyerOfLiberty,dcouxuk,"Catalonia might be a better example.

Well, revenue did go up, in inflation adjusted dollars.  taxes [for the rich](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49440) also went up.  so other than being totally wrong, not bad.

true, but it doesn't prove what you claim.  the richest 1/5 make 55% of income, they pay 70% of taxes.  that's not income tax, that's all federal taxes, including cap gains.

* First, every state gets one seat, no matter what its population is. (If not for this rule, then 4 states wouldn't get a seat at all.)

* Then, you take each state's population, and divide it by sqrt(2*(2-1)). And then divide it by sqrt(3*(3-1)).  And then by sqrt(4*(4-1)). And you go out as far as you might possibly need for each state. (This is called the Method of Equal Proportions.)

* So, 50 seats have already been allocated. Who gets the 51st seat? Well, it's whichever state has the highest of those calculated numbers above; for this seat, which state has the highest result when you divide their population by sqrt(2*(2-1)), using 2 because you're allocating a state's second seat.

* Who gets the 52nd seat? Whichever state has the highest result when you divide their population by sqrt(n*(n-1)), where n is one more than however many seats that state ""already"" has.

* After you've allocated the 435th seat, you're done.

It would be weird to try to figure out exactly ""why"" a state might gain a seat after you re-allocate when adding another state. You'd kind of have to just go through all the calculations one at a time to see ""where"" the change happened. Part of it would have to do with the change in the population of the ""average"" seat across the country: 435 divided by the population of the 50 states is different from 435 divided by the population of 51 or 52 states when you add PR and/or DC."dcp145l,1484959224,RealBlueShirt,dcp28mz,"It is interesting that there are two people posting here that know each other so well.

There is a lot that can be done, mind you. There are plenty of systemic reforms that would benefit society as a whole and serve to level the playing field a bit. Police reform is a good idea. Judicial reform is a good idea. These tackle the root of the problem, by trying to reduce current discrimination in the government. Even if you do manage to push through reparations, if you don't do this, you've accomplished nothing.

Reparations though, they don't really do much in that regard. The case for reparations isn't particularly solid anyway- we as a society don't believe in punishing the child for the sins of the parent, and that's what it *will* be seen as. You'll have to explain to a group of people who have never done anything particularly discriminatory themselves why they owe a different part of society something. ""Because the great great grandparents of someone who looks like you took advantage of the great great grandparents of someone who look's like them back in the day, and as a result they've been at a big disadvantage ever since"" isn't going to cut it.

While he won election to the House as a Republican from Texas (no small feat at the time, although he was an oil man with good connections), he literally lost every other election he ever ran in except for 1988. He ran for Senator of Texas and lost that one, mightily I think. He ran for President in 1976 and 1980 and lost both bids. 1988 he won ""on the coattails of Reagan."" And then he got carved up again in 1992. When you compare him to the campaigning of Reagan, Clinton, George W Bush, and Obama, he clearly stands out as having a much worse record.

He was much more at home as a technocrat in international politics. He seemed to be an effective CIA director and ambassador to the UN. I could tell from the museum that he enjoyed that work very much. And he was on the ticket with Reagan to shore up the foreign affairs aspect of the ticket.

I don't see any way to reconcile moderates/progressives and ""progressives"" at this point because there are no defined ways forward.

""progressives"" have drawn a hard line saying that everyone who voted Trump doesn't just disagree with them, they took a deliberate malicious action based entirely on racist/fascist ideals. Anyone who disagrees is labelled a racist.

The problem here is there doesn't seem to be any outcome that will actually satisfy this base. If you claim that you're not racist/fascist, you are, and if you admit that you have prejudices that you're trying to deal with, you're still a racist/fascist. There's no forward motion no where do we go now? It's all just this angry self-pity or whatever because it's not about actually solving the problem, it's about having a reason to actively dehumanize the outgroup.

There's been a complete refusal to entertain anything but this mindset and as someone who believes that hatred of immigrants/minorities is more of a social disease that requires treatment which can be accomplished through the democratic party I've already established myself as too moderate for the radical left which doesn't really seem to have any views on the matter beyond ""everyone who voted Trump is racist and therefore terrible and undeserving of anything beyond the slow painful decline into poverty that awaits them""

Honestly the only way forward is for the more moderate progressives to cut off the more extreme faction, and then rally the moderates behind them.

I meant to say an American company with significant interests/brands/holdings/import rights in Mexico. Constellation is an American company paying American taxes, employing Americans, etc. 

It doesn't make sense to move production og Corona or Modelo to the US, and isn't possible for a product like Tequila which (similar to Champagne) can only be produced in a specific part of Mexico. 

Constellation, or a similar company, don't have a huge production force they are moving in or out of the US. That is why I brought them up as an example, because it highlights the complexity of the global market that large American companies work within, and the lack of nuance or thought that a blanket 20% tax/tariff on things coming from mexico would bring to the table. 

i'm just going to edit the comment above because people aren't even reading past the first line.

However, bottom line is that everyone has a boss and refusing to do your job as directed will most likely get you fired.  

If an agent alters paperwork or otherwise knowingly misrepresents data on someone trying to enter the country it seems likely they would fall under forgery statues. Which does include the option of 25 year jail time. While the Trump administration would absolutely pursue this I think it is likely some amount of judges would take pity. 

Regardless, I think it is likely in the next few days we will see cases like this where agents act under the conscience instead of the law.

If 90% of healthcare spending or more is done by a single entity, and that entity has authority to bargain, these ridiculous prices can be forced down.  A hospital cannot make up any price it wants if 90% of healthcare dollars are paid by a single entity.  Ditto anyone else.  

Now, one classic macroeconomic failure when you force prices down - essentially set a price ceiling - is a shortage.

This is where the ""death panels"" and the waiting lists come in.  With a healthcare system that always has a shortage of actual care available (since at the price it is willing to pay, there are a finite number of doctors and hospitals) versus care demanded, you have to deny expensive, futile care to those who will probably die anyway and you have to make people wait in line for marginally useful, nonessential care.  (like back surgery)

Can't have one without the other.  The way it works now, there is still a shortage in that not everyone gets what they need, nor is there actually enough medicine or doctors for everyone, but instead it's a bidding war, and those who can pay the most get all the care they want and then some, while those who cannot pay enough get nothing."dchw9uh,1484615705,Chicken2nite,dcisgou,"Baring any revolutionary new method, I think there might be a floor on install costs, though.
