That's a *great* argument for why the unborn should not be said to have equal moral status. 

And that is one I agree with. 

However, I still believe the unborn has a large moral status, though not equivalent to an adult human like the mother is. 

&gt;Obviously at some point it happens but conception seems like such an odd line to draw for me given basic science (40% of fertilized eggs not being implanted, things like ectopic pregnancies).

I don't understand your logic here.

It's certainly tragic that around 50%(in total, including failed implantations) of pregnancies end in the death of the unborn. That's a pretty bad mortality rate. Much better than pre modern medicine, but still bad. 

But why do you think that mortality rate should affect the consideration of the philosophical concept of Personhood? 

Yes, it's a tragic figure, and current medical technology has not developed to a level where we can do anything about it. 

But your logic here seems to be this: ""It's sad to think 40% of people die, so therefore people don't exist till later on, so all those pregnancies that failed beforehand aren't actually people.""

Why do you think the mortality rate at certain periods of a human's development should dictate whether or not they are a person? Is it just because you find it sad to think about?

&gt;Also I'm a Christian and I don't even find ""life at conception"" to be biblical given my close reading of the text.

Think of it like an ""on your honor"" candy jar where people are asked to put in a quarter for a mint. Just because you've only seen one or two people not paying doesn't mean alot more people aren't paying, because you're not set up to catch people not paying. Giving your name and address is a ki d of control, but it's not a strong one.

I don't *think* there's a ton of in-person voter fraud. The risk -od isn't there. But we're not in a place to know because we don't test for it.

Check the Box if you're not a felon or otherwise prohibited from voting. Fill in address. Mail in.)

LOL yeah I'm sure he wanted the investigation over with as soon as possible, just like Trump, so he added more people. Implying Trump punished Comey for adding more people to an investigation is a nutjob conspiracy theory entirely and fundamentally based on correlation equals causation, which is a fallacy. 

&gt;Fact: Comey declined a preview of his Senate testimony to the Trump administration, which infuriated Trump

You realize the FBI is part of the executive branch right? That means Trump was Comey's boss. I would also be furious if an employee of mine declined to do something I asked. Did you actually think this makes Trump look guilty somehow?

&gt;Fact: The letters provided by the AG, deputy AG, and Trump firing Comey, were all written on the day Comey was fired

This is so irrelevant it's mindboggling. I know what you're trying to imply though. You're trying to imply this was a total last minute freak response to Comey adding more people to the investigation, which I already explained was nonsense. The DAG, Rod Rosenstein, was only in that position for two weeks. Was he supposed to write the letter before he was appointed???

&gt;Fact: Trump, despite being warned by Obama, the acting AG, and the FBI, that Flynn was compromised, and despite being shown evidence supporting those warnings, kept Flynn on for 18 additional days, and even allowed him to join a phone call with Putin

Thats great but it has absolutely  nothing to do with Comey. Have you just been listing random unconnected facts this whole time?

&gt;EDIT: Oh! I have another one. Fact: Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigations into Trump's campaign, but drafted a letter to the president recommending he fire the director of the FBI currently engaged in that investigation.

I have absolutely no idea what you think this fact implies but lets play this out logically: if sessions did NOT recuse himself from the investigation you'd just come up with another conspiracy theory saying Sessions was meddling with the investigation that he was part of. There's no eventuality where Sessions isn't doing something guilty in your mind, hence there's no reason to think this point has any relevance. 

Like my prior point, the AG is the head of the justice department, therefore the AG is the direct boss of the director of the FBI. If Trump wanted to fire the head of the FBI for incompetence he absolutely, without question, should have a recommendation letter from the AG, which of course is Sessions. 

&gt;Double edit: He also recused himself from anything relating to Clinton's emails - which is the reason Trump gave for firing Clinton, so he violated two recusals at once!

Slow down there, nobody's firing Clinton.....Definitely not a violation of a any recusal. If Comey was caught selling secrets to China would it be a violation of Sessions' recusal to recommend he gets fired?? Of course not, the idea is absurd. If he recused himself from two cases it's not a ""violation,"" whatever you think that means, if he fires the head of the FBI who likely is only giving casual oversight to those investigations. Which brings me to another point:

You have a common problem I see many redditors try to casually slip by yet it's completely wrong: Comey likely had very little to do with the ""russia investigation"". He was the head of an organization of 35 thousand people. he had many many responsibilities yet redditors think he was spending an inordinate amount of time on just one case out of thousands. He was 2000 miles away from DC when he found out about getting fired during a speech he was giving, he traveled alot and did all sorts of executive duties. The extent of his involvement was likely just weekly memos from the team of investigators. "dhuwk10,1495678425,datbino,di0bg7v,Go figure lol-  gotta get that op info while your still on top.

&gt;To the second point, states have always been allowed to not do it, but I was speaking in terms of the issues about the U.S. Constitution, not state law. In other words, that's what would be required for the Supreme Court to say that universities are not allowed to have affirmative action programs because it violates the Equal Protection Clause.

Tbh something like that would probably need to be brought via an amendment. I can't imagine it politically flying, but as you said if it a ban is warranted, racial tension may have actually eased to the point where it wouldn't be contested at all.

&gt;I don't have any information to the contrary, but do you have source that shows that if, say, Yale used non-race criteria to rank its applicants and picked the top one-thousand based solely on objective criteria, the resulting class would have an identical racial make-up?

I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm not saying if you admitted everyone by randomized test scores and GPA the racial composition of Yale would be the same. It would probably end up being majority or plurality Asian, then white, then black,other and Hispanic. First of all, there isn't anyway to objectively rank someone for american admissions. A big part of going to a good public or private university is the holistic nature of admissions. If you based admissions entirely on objective criteria universities wouldn't be able to cultivate a diverse student body, and by diverse, I mean diversity of talent, interest and personality ,not race.

 The superficial truth for undergrad is that the reason many kids want to go to an Ivy is because of the prestige and networking options. It's true that they generally have really good professors, but strictly in terms of academics, they probably aren't commensurately better than your state school for the price difference( assuming you pay full price which to be fair most people dont). The question then becomes how do these elite universities keep their standard high and ,as you said, their donors happy. Most of the old money in the US is predominantly WASPy, and you're more or less going to on average have an easier time getting ahead in the corporate world or high earning industries if you're white. America  obviously has a very bad history in terms of racism, but the racial majority in every country is going to more or less have the highest earning potential (except in some third world countries). Im saying this as a mixed (black/white) international at an Ivy, who has been black in a white country and white in a black country.
Look at the # of Asian Fortune 500 CEOs http://fortune.com/2011/10/07/is-there-a-bamboo-ceiling-at-u-s-companies/ from a few years back. The number, along with the numbers of other minorities, is pretty low. It's a constant push and pull between wanting to promote ""diversity"", while also wanting to continue being ""elite"".

 So essentially every year theses schools need to craft a class they think will add to the academic, atmospheric, and prestigious elements of the school. Don't get me wrong, some of the brightest minds will end up going to Yale every year, but every kid they choose is chosen to expand the reputation some way. IMO, in a hypothetical situation where a student's name and race are not included on his/her application, the elite schools would just try and infer race. They may limit the number of ""stereotypical Asian"" application if they thought they had too many Asians,  admit more kids from expensive prep schools if they thought they needed a higher white population, increase admission from poorer urban schools if they needed  more non-asian minorities etc. It probably wouldn't allow them to craft their ideal class as easily as they can now, but imo it would be pretty close.

Correct.  

The entire story is that Trump revealed the city in the IS where the information on the laptop threat came from.  That is it.  

That is the entire disclosure.  

The entire rest of the story indicates that this is somehow a breach of security because this lets the Russians know who the ally is because ofwhere the info came from, and how bad Trump is in the opinions of former Obama Administration employees and Democrats.    

1. The Russians already know where the info came from on the laptop story.  Once the US and UK banned laptops on certain flights, the Russians already knew *which* 'ally' the info came from.  This 'disclosure' tells them nothing.

2. The White House moved to strike the memos to the *Press*, not the Russians.  The Russians already know who is telling what from their intelligence and the laptop ban, so it was the *Public* which was the security risk.  The Public that the WaPo screamed about as soon as they learned that there was a move to contain the information.

3. 'Former Officials', which means Obama Administration officials, indicate this 'ally' is already frustrated about US Intelligence disclosures.  Because the WaPo, NYT, and Reuters did *not* indicate it was Trump disclosures, this means it was Obama Administration disclosures.  This has been an ongoing concern with *any* and all statements, advisories, operations, and deployments throughout the entire War on Terror.  That aspect of the story is meaningless.  

4. The story is a confirmational story about how bad the President is and don't we all hate him.  

5. The story is 'undeniable'.  We don't know *who* the 'officials' are (except for the former officials, they know nothing about this, because they are former.  Their comments are background color), therefore we cannot determine exactly what was said.  The story leans heavily on speculation with *one* fact.  It's a terrible story and it makes the WaPo look terrible, and feeds into Trump's 'Fake News' narrative.

Perhaps the most obvious example, is that democracy gives the people the power to willingly give away their power to decide anything.

But there are other examples. For example, a completely free market will inherently tend towards monopolies, destroying the freedom of the market. Therefore, government actively regulates the market to keep it ""optimally free"" for a long time, rather than completely free for a short time.

Free speech has the same problem. Without any regulation, free speech can lead to some voices to gain a lot of attention and others none, not merely based on their respective merit, but because of external factors. Celebrities who gain a large audience for other reason and are then able to go into politics is a clear example of this, but not necessarily a problem that is big enough to warrant regulation.

A clearer example in America, is how you basically allow moneyed interests to shape your political discourse. Since money=speech, it is obvious that those who already have money, will be able to share their message to a further degree than those without money, and thus decide the direction of the discussion, to the detriment of the free and open discourse of the country. Regulating how much money can be spent on campaigning for candidates is a direct violation of free speech, but it might preserve ""optimal free speech"" for longer than a blanket ""free speech"" dogma.

From this perspective, it is defensible to have certain (clearly defined) rules in place to avoid certain perspectives to drown out others. Call it some sort of free speech anti-trust laws, for example by guaranteeing that there will aways be speakers of minority backgrounds at panel debates, or even silencing certain voices if they themselves actively make it hard for other voices to be heard."dhpburx,1495083312,atl2ptown,dhpjx0z,The President wasn't the point of the question.

That doesn't explain though, why they voted against the ACA yet their own bill has the problems they cited in the ACA, only on steroids. 

For instance, the alleged death spiral in the ACA is in the AHCA in a way that ensures the AHCA will fail and fail quickly. The ACA penalizes people for not having insurance, pushing them towards getting insurance. The AHCA incentivizes the young and health to prolong getting insurance as long as possible by raising their costs once they want back in, thus letting the young and healthy go years without paying a dime. The economics of the AHCA ensure a death spiral starts on a day one. 

So it's entirely fucked up how they opposed the ACA for reasons like that but then go ahead and put titan sized versions in their own bill. "dh4v5sb,1493965305,remyspam,dh5n2u4,"&gt; then they will lose bigly in 2018 and 2020

What would be the difference? If the Freedom Caucus could field winning candidates in those primaries, why wouldn't they?

Monsanto should not be able to patent a seed. Nestle should not be able to own a clean source of water. I'd like to move more towards India's mentality when it comes to patents on things derived from natural sources. You can't patent plants. (I don't know if this would be popular, I haven't seen it discussed much. But it would be one way of lowering the price of some meds and would keep the marajuana industry from being taken over). 

However, this will probably never ever happen, the pharma lobbying is too strong. Congress tried to put forth a bill focusing on making drugs less expensive and it was killed pretty quickly.

"dh2fby3,1493818815,Wafflebury,dh2oak4,"Many economists like to try and analyze labor markets with supply and demand, but it's really not a good tool for doing that. Labor is not particularly mobile, so it's easy for markets to become inefficient. S/D also assumes workers can simply choose whether they get more ""utility"" from a wage or free time, or they can shop for the best wages. It doesn't work like that. Single moms aren't spitting 75 hour weeks at 2-3 minimum wage jobs because of a value decision on their time. That's what employers pay, so workers accept it. Even if another employer is paying more, when is that person going to have free time to find that job? ""My free time isn't worth this amount, so I'm going to quit my jobs and hope my child doesn't starve while I find a place that pays me what I'm worth!"" Finally, there's a power dynamic between employers and employees that messes up this model. Individual employees have no bargaining power and are often very replaceable. Employers hold all the cards here.

More practically, let's take a look at your solutions. Reducing low skill immigrant labor is not a good one. We can see that happening now with seasonal labor on farms. I forget the exact numbers but without immigrants, farms were unable to fill 1000s of jobs this year. Americans don't want them. People didn't apply. Immigration isn't taking your jobs, rich people are, and technology, and they're blaming immigration because it's politically expedient. Reducing corporate taxes sounds nice in your SD framework, but there's no way to guarantee that goes to job creation. History tells us it likely won't. Once again, SD isn't a good tool got analyzing labor. Firms won't hire more workers just because they have more money to do so, they'll hire more workers if and only if they need to. In the age of ""cost cutting - shareholder value"" management, there needs to be other reasons for employers to hire besides the fact that they keep more of their revenue. For proof, look at the rise of corporate profits over the past decade -- how much of that has gone to workers? 

As a liberal I would support low corporate taxes and high income taxes for the rich, to encourage reinvestment of profits into the business, as one of several solutions. But that alone would not be enough."6apwc5,1494692764,[deleted],dhieit7,[removed]dhcv1cx,1494424065,deviladvokate,dhdgxab,"Maybe they like you more than me, haha.

In a time period measuring in months we could go from a balanced 4-4-1 Supreme Court to 6-3 Republican Court.  Combine that with a massive conservative shift at the federal level (Republican filibusters have left approximately 12% of federal seats vacant) and sole check or balance on the Republican Party will disappear.

At that point many things will happen.  On the small scale, abortion and gay rights end.  On the larger scale, every shady practice used to help Republicans win elections could be explicitly legal and sanctioned, from gerrymandering to dark money.  It is very possible for a party with no court opposition to write themselves a majority.

If we go so far, the legislative filibuster doesn't stand a chance.  If the minority ever actually needs it to survive, it will prove slim protections (much like the military, which would favor Trump and the Republicans in a such a coup). 

On a less pessimistic timescale, there is little reason to abolish the filibuster.  Bills are failing because of infighting, not filibustering.

As humans and even scientists we should approach everything with a grain of skepticism so honestly I could commend Cletus for not believing everything someone says to him. Is he dumb for trying to argue with someone when he has done no research or possess no experience, yes. Also scientists should talk to the common or lower man since we wouldn't want politicians making decisions without the common mans input which could drastically effect our lives as we know it some would say for the worse. Let's take climate change, which does exist btw, Cletus starts asking scientist Bill who is trying to push for reforms, politically, which would cost extra money which Cletus needs to feed his family. Asking why or even showing skepticism about a topic is a good thing science approaches everything as a hypothesis and here Cletus' hypothesis would be Climate change doesn't exist or it's ramifications are overstated. If scientists Bill just brushes him off because ""I have a doctorate and you don't"" he is becoming the problem by not taking time to step out of his ivory tower and actually help change minds. Obviously not everybody is like dear old inquisitive Cletus but they exist. ""To paint with a wide brush and just say those who don't believe fully in X are anti-intellectual"" is beyond idiotic in my book. Just my two cents.

A reduction in a penalty is not automatically a subsidy.

You are arguing from a strict definition of subsidy which is not the mainstream definition. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp

Tax breaks are subsidies that assume a frame of reference that being taxed is the zero point. If a government wants to make solar panels cheaper, they can either give money to companies that manufacture solar panels, or give tax breaks to companies that manufacture solar panels. The final outcome for the government's budget balancing and the company budget will be identical. Since both outcomes are identical, tax cuts are a means with which behaviors are subsidized. 

&gt; We ""favor"" investment because its most important. Without investment, there's no labor to tax.

Without labor, there aren't any returns on investment either. 

&gt; On this, I generally agree, but I'm also of the viewpoint that all taxes need to be much lower than they are.

A good first step is a revenue neutral hike in capital gains matched by a cut to income taxes. "dhmp352,1494947869,Acrimony01,dhmqhxu,"An entire post about how everything I said about Hillary is wrong.

I think it's more a subset of Democrats. I know this is a generalization, but I think it's the younger Democrats that can't be trusted. Most young people are Democrats; understandably because colleges are liberal so they are exposed mostly to the Liberal ideology plus Democrat social policies benefit lower income people more, including young people. But as everyone knows, young people are more fickle: their political viewpoints are less mature/they are experimenting and they are more idealistic. Consequently, when someone isn't 100% perfect (like Clinton), they didn't vote for her or spoiled their ballot.

In contrast, many people as they get older become more conservative since once you enter the real world, you start getting exposed to other perspectives outside the college liberal bubble. Moreover, Conservative policies begin to impact you, especially when you start earning beyond 100K. In addition, you are less fickle; once you get married or have children, you HAVE to learn how to compromise to have a successful relationship. 

Both of these factors make Democrats in general less loyal than Republicans. There are older loyal Democrats that vote Democrat every time but the younger crowd is way more fickle.

Sanders has been very deliberately ambiguous about his own religious beliefs--sometimes offering contradictory statements.  Even though many of his policy proposals seem rooted in a certain stand of Jewish thought, he is very clear that he wants these policies viewed through a humanist lens.   A nominally conservative working class white voter from Western Pennsylvania would see Sanders faith through that lens, and would view it as a strike against him.

And the polling bears this out.  [A full third of voters think Sanders is irreligious](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/01/27/religion-and-the-2016-presidential-candidates/). This would be a huge problem in a country where 51% of Americans consider atheism to be an electoral demerit.

* Pragmatism/rationality over party obedience
* Push for institutional reform

It is thanks to this that Macron could credibly claim to represent a ""Revolution"" despite being a moderate on most ideological issues. There is simply no comparison with the Clintons, who are both very attached to the political system in the USA. Obama is a more interesting comparison in some ways, but he was running as a very clear democrat, based on values (""Change, Hope"") that are not the same as those that Macron tries to embody (""Rationality, Merit"").

Just as the IC is called to step in now, it's also a convenient time for them to step up their influence.

I understand this is an intensive process, and that sources get double checked and everything, but then you remember we're talking about world class espionage agencies. Their entire job is to deceptive and gain influence. 




But I agree with you. The Trump disgrace is the perfect time for the IC to drop leaks. At this point, though, we pretty much know the president is in hot water- why do we need more?

The body of evidence necessary to debate the allegations against Bork is too large, and the historical context (in which I will confess to not being extremely well versed) too significant to relitigate them here. Your claim is that they were false, or substantially exaggerated, and made in bad faith to discredit a nominee they didn't like; to which I reply: then why did six Republicans find them convincing enough to vote against heir own party's nominee? Maybe they were unfair, but they clearly weren't ridiculous, or they wouldn't have been effective.

More broadly, though, I think you're using a very weird definition of obstructionism. Wikipedia defines it as ""the practice of deliberately delaying or preventing a process or change, especially in politics."" Robert Bork was nominated on July 1, 1987. He received a vote in the Judiciary Committee on October 6, and a vote in the full Senate on October 23, 1987. Anthony Kennedy was nominated for the seat on November 11, and confirmed on February 3, 1988.

Not a single senator voted against Anthony Kennedy's confirmation. 

Opposition is not obstruction. Democratic senators were not attempting to prevent the seat from being filled, nor were they trying to prevent it from being filled by a Reagan appointee, or a Republican. They were trying to prevent it from being filled by Robert Bork. Maybe they were unfair to him; maybe they lied about him; but it was about Bork, not Republicans vs. Democrats, and that isn't obstruction, it's opposition."dhki8d9,1494878392,the_sam_ryan,dhlivq6,"What is the ""on-her-death-bed""?

(https://www.dallasnews.com/news/news/2016/05/17/ut-study-long-before-fracking-oil-and-gas-activities-caused-texas-earthquakes).

I may be completely ignorant on this, but it seems to me that a good way to curb CO2 emissions would be to subsidize an already rapidly-growing renewable energy sector. The market is already making renewables a tough option to ignore as a path forward for energy companies (higher storage capacity in solar reservoirs, the emergence of wind energy corridors in places like the Southwest, increased accessibility to renewable energy in consumer and commercial applications etc), and subsidizing clean energy may be enough to push these companies over the edge.

According to Wikipedia, fossil fuel subsidies were $5.3 trillion in 2015 (6.5% of global GDP mind you), while in 2011 renewable energy subsidies were $88 billion (couldn't find a more recent figure). Perhaps the scales should tip the other way a bit?

In India and at times in America where the government was decentralized, it did not matter if your party had national power as local elections are more important.

Tell me, what does it say about a candidate when their positions are more similar to an openly racist and arguably pro-fascist candidate than a moderate?

I'd argue that if your preferred candidate is closer to Le Pen than Macron, your vote on _both_ rounds was indefensible.

&gt; Nevermind 45% of Macron's voters voted for him as a strategic vote in the first round, the highest proportion.

Given that Mlenchon's voters appear to be the least willing to vote strategically (given that they apparently mostly sat out at disproportionate rates), it seems pretty obvious that Mlenchon would not have won even if there had been no strategic votes.  But even ignoring that, you aren't really rescuing your position here.  You were indeed free officially to show your support for your favorite candidate (rather than your least disliked candidate) in an environment where doing so would not cause harm.  To the extent that you wanted to deliver it, your message was heard clearly in the first round.  It's just that you were outnumbered by people with a different message.

Look at this another way: in analyzing your argument, we're only interested in strategic Macron voters who's preferred candidate was actually Mlenchon.  Everyone else already had their preference for Mlenchon officially recorded, and my initial argument clearly applies to them.  So what does a strategic vote for Macron say?  It says that while you wanted someone else to win, you'd prefer him winning over Le Pen winning (voting strategically for Macron would have to goal of getting him over 50% so that the second round could be skipped altogether, thus minimizing the chances of a Le Pen victory).  But then to do anything other than voting Macron is to say that you _wouldn't_ prefer Macron over Le Pen.  It's incoherent, and therefore anyone who did vote that way is still behaving irrationally.

&gt; Still, Mlenchon's voters had the opportunity yesterday to show they don't feel represented by this configuration of the second round, and some took it.

Objectively true.  The question is whether doing so was rational or responsible.  And the answer is clearly no.  Saying that the second round should have been different despite the results of the first round is effectively claiming that _your_ preference in candidates is more important than the voters."dhard97,1494275305,unbannable02,dhasmsz,"&gt; Political experience is not a requirement.

It's literally a microcosm of the issue that the EC is designed to solve. 20 of 29 congress people from New York are Democrats, meanwhile the state went to Hillary 60-40 (ignoring 3rds). 

20/29 is 68%, which isn't *that* disproportionate compared to 60%. It sounds like the majority of the state is represented fine. I'm missing the ""problem"" that the EC is supposedly addressing here. What is the ""correct"" percentage of Democrats vs. Republicans in NY's congressional delegation, given what we know?

&gt; So...when did Texas become a federation of cities/counties? If not, it's not a good illustration of anything. It's not particularly ridiculous and if Texas wants to go that way, that's fine. That said, urban areas tend to amplify the voices in them, while creating an echo chamber that tends to make them more one sided, so giving MORE power to urban areas seems ridiculous for entirely different reasons than you are attempting to suggest.

Again, I'm sort of losing the thinking here. You ask if Texas is a federation of cities/counties. Why would that be relevant? Couldn't they be a federation that uses a popular vote, or a single state that reweighs rural/urban voters?

And this claim could use a bit more support/elaboration: ""That said, urban areas tend to amplify the voices in them, while creating an echo chamber that tends to make them more one sided, so giving MORE power to urban areas seems ridiculous for entirely different reasons than you are attempting to suggest"" I'm both having a REALLY hard time understanding it and don't see much sourcing on it, which seems necessary for what seems to be a big claim.

&gt; Serious question, and I mean no offense here, do you not understand the viewpoints of those who disagree with you? I understand the arguments against the EC very well, I just disagree with them. In fact, I think understanding the viewpoints that you disagree with is very important to arguing against them. I want it changed some but I don't disagree with the logic of having it. 

I mean, I read a lot of these threads, so I definitely have seen these arguments, but a lot of them get repeated a lot and still don't make a lot of sense. My larger point is that having the confidence of the governed is a pretty critical part of living in a republic (in fact, it's the very definition of what a republic *is*) and so things that undercut that (like giving certain voters more voice) ought to only be done with *extreme* caution and reasoning. And I just don't see that in many of the arguments I see on here, part of why I'm asking for more elaboration / clarification.

The EC compromise was enacted in the 1700's to get slave-holding states on board with joining a new government that had a president.

I generally agree with this, but I do think that there's a significant systemic weakness that's already apparent with the Attorney General being appointed by the President and the Justice Department's independence resting more on traditions and norms than concrete legal prohibitions and obligations. 

Although it's appropriate for the President to be able to select an A.G. and set law enforcement priorities, the President and A.G. shouldn't be able to stop an investigation into the administration or decide whether recusal and an independent investigator/prosecutor is needed due to actual or apparent conflicts of interest (or when there are other bases to question prosecutorial impartiality). 

I think the old independent counsel statute that expired was vastly better than what we have now, even if it had some problems and perverse incentives that needed to be addressed.  Under that statute, the independent counsel was appointed and overseen by a panel of appellate judges from the D.C. Circuit who would, in theory, be a lot more insulated from partisan politics and thus be able to evaluate the necessity of the appointment more objectively. 

One possible alternative would be to independently elect the DoJ's Inspector General, perhaps with a staggered term that didnn't coincide with the Presidential election, and give the office prosecutorial authority independent from the A.G. Another potential reform would be to just make the U.S. A.G. an elected office. This would require a Constitutional Amendment. It would be interesting to see empirical data on how well elected state A.G.s perform compared to appointed ones both in investigating and checking the power of Governors, as well as on how they affect overall government performance.

That's a tough declaration to make, I think. [Support](http://www.people-press.org/2016/08/26/public-views-about-guns/#party) for gun control vs rights of ownership is much more ""in play"" among independents compared to Republicans, which should be an area of focus for Dems, but again, this comes down to educating everyone (base included) about the nuances and outcomes of gun control. 


&gt;You're absolutely correct that the issue is very complex, which is exactly why no one should have any illusions about subtle shifts in policy filtering down to the electorate in any meaningful way. 

[Polling]( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/24/5-facts-about-the-nra-and-guns-in-america/) gives me reason for [pause](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/05/5-facts-about-guns-in-the-united-states/). A key area for Dems to refine is educating themselves and their voters on assault weapons. [Heres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcJLOrX8TbU) a debate that encompasses informed views and uninformed views of what is lawful and practical.

**The issue?**

The focus on assault weapons is built upon specious reasoning and inadequate understanding. No worries, things are complicated and I dont fully grasp gun violence/control like I dont fully grasp the tax system or health insurance. What truly embarrasses me, as a democrat and a liberal, is the exploitation of mass shootings to promulgate gun control. If we can chastise the Bush administration and conservatives for using 9/11 as a cudgel to go to war and especially to pass sweeping domestic surveillance legislation, we should recognize it in our own camp. Its bullshit, and it needs to stop. The fact that, say, the Pulse shooter had legally-owned guns shouldnt, after examination, conclude with the need for stricter gun control (to me). It should conclude, after examination, the fact that anyone, at any time, can commit violence for a variety of reasons.

But on the national stage, Democrats proselytize about cosmetic features of guns that, at the end of the day, still only expel one round per trigger pull. The effects of pistol grips and light rails and extended capacity magazines are negligible. [Handguns]( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2010-2014.xls) kill many times more people than all other gun types combined. Furthermore, what public safety effect do bans have on certain guns that still fundamentally perform the same way? We have a second amendment, and people tend to be fanatical about it. Getting on with this in a sensible manner would be a good place to start. To wit:

**A solution?**

Democrats could simply move away from talking about assault weapons. Its really that simple. The numbers are all there, both in overall reduction in crime, and a in the dearth of evidence that would support rifles and shotguns (targeted by these bans) being more dangerous than handguns. Educate all voters, but chiefly the Democratic base, that the Democratic party supports responsible gun ownership and instead focus on what specific demographics (ex. felons, fly risks, etc.) *should* be limited in purchasing guns. Expanding background checks has widespread support, though its [complicated]( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/05/5-facts-about-guns-in-the-united-states/). Attack the logic behind exempting gun shows from background checks (private sales are trickier).

Lob the ball back towards the NRA! Im talking majorly putting the impetus on the NRA to support expanded background checks at gun shows and universal background checks for all gun sales, though its [challenging]( http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/obamas-senate-gun-outreach-falling-short-088055). Implore the NRA to [support]( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-missouri-idUSKCN0ZD24M) state-level efforts to qualify for [conceal/carry permits]( http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/new-missouri-gun-law-changes-the-rules-but-some-restrictions/article_52cae4d3-310c-5c89-a55e-007ec99fefbf.html). Is an 8 hour gun safety course an undue burden if you wish to carry around a gun? Dont overreact to mass shootings, but in their wake, take a position of humility, one that promotes understanding, and then turn the pressure up on the NRA to support some acceptable entity researching the public health effects and outcomes of gun violence, since they [dont support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2015/01/14/why-the-cdc-still-isnt-researching-gun-violence-despite-the-ban-being-lifted-two-years-ago/?utm_term=.21ea2187d885) the CDC conducting those studies.

Mental health funding, decreasing mandatory minimums, stopping the drug war writ large, and treating drug addiction as a public health crisis as opposed to a criminal scourge are all hugely important measures to decrease gun violence. I cant stress this enough...Democratic messaging tends to marginalize lawful gun owners, the VAST (by orders of magnitude) majority of which have absolutely no involvement in crime, gun or otherwise, amid all the hysteria over controlling guns. Fighting that battle seems futile, always.

"dh3b92k,1493853186,[deleted],dh3j4s5,[deleted]dhotnvn,1495057454,ketsebum,dhp06z9,"&gt;The problem with this is that numerous studies in numerous fields have demonstrated that race is most certainly a relevant factor when looking at outcomes. Later in your post you talk about ""typical outcomes,"" but this is exactly what these race-based policies are aimed at. Of course there are black people who don't need AA to be competitive college applicants, but more do than don't.

My typical outcomes argument was being used in a general sense for the single vs dual parent households. If you are actually going to make a policy regarding something as such, you should do better research. Likewise, find a causal factor that contributes to the reason. There is a correlation, but not necessarily causation for later in life outcomes that are described.

&gt;Sure. I'll grant that all things with a finite cap on participants are ultimately zero-sum games, but this is a really silly argument.

We are talking about decision making process with regards to race. On a small scale, zero sum doesn't apply because we are talking about the individual case where quite literally it is A vs B. On a large scale if you want to discriminate based solely on race across the entire market, zero sum argument also doesn't make any sense. As it is a force being applied across the board, one that in its base nature is racist.

&gt; It's like playing 20 turns of Monopoly and then deciding after all of the property has been bought that you're going to ""restart"" the game from Go; it's impossible to set up an environment in which everyone has equal opportunities for success unless you prop up those who have fewer starting resources. In the same way, you can't in good faith say that it's wrong to give black Americans a boost in college apps because it wouldn't be fair to white applicants when the latter have, for decades, been brought up in better schools due to both de jure and de facto segregation. You can't just say ""OKAY GUYS, NO MORE RACISM"" and expect to have different outcomes when the institutional biases that caused the differing outcomes have long since had their effect.

What about the people who aren't black but were slaves, or indentured servants or in general wronged by society?

In good faith, you can say making a racist decision is wrong. Choosing an applicant because of their race is wrong. That is the easiest thing in the world to say in good faith.

But, if we are going to play this game that previous discrimination means they should get a boost, what about the women in our society? They have certainly have had discrimination against them, and I gotta tell you, every single generation in my family line has had women in it. We should definitely give those people a boost right?

Fact is, the amount of previous discrimination or wrong doing any family has had in their lifetime is immeasurable and unknowable. We shouldn't be making racist decisions to try to fix a broken past. Two wrongs don't make a right.

&gt;The children of black families typically have worse outcomes than those of white families. We're targeting a group of people who could use help, not doing it based on their whatever. There is a need among black Americans for this kind of assistance - 

There are more poor white Americans than black Americans. If we are targeting by race and by bigger need, then there is a bigger pool of people that we could target with assistance.

&gt;why is it so unpalatable to give it to them because the demographic we're targeting happens to be a race?

Several reasons.

1. Race does not give you any information about the person or their past or whether or not they need / require / or are owed any sort of help.

2. Racist decisions propagate more racists decisions.

3. Ultimately, doesn't solve the problem of wealth inequality across ethnic groups or life outcomes in a meaningful way.

It is ultimately the wrong way to approach the problem.

And the cuts will absolutely come once DeVos gets her way.  Even a small percent of the kids going to religious schools via funding from the public schools means mass layoffs and school closings.

All that could have been avoided had they and people like them realized there was quite a bit of daylight between Clinton and Trump afterall.  Even if you loved Bernie (as I did!) it was silly to not recognize a difference.  And it was even more silly to convince others of the same.

Can you really argue with that track record?

Absolutely.  First, I was unaware Canada and the UK are the only other developed nations.  The majority of Europe doesn't have single-payer and some countries have undeniably better health outcomes than single-payer.

Second, the UK isn't able to graduate nearly enough doctors to fill the demand for them - they import massive numbers of doctors from Eastern Europe.  English doctors come to the US, because they earn considerably more.  We can already bring down costs considerably just by importing foreign healthcare workers that will work for pennies on the dollar.  I'm not sure that's necessarily a wise move, just like we could massively decrease the amount spent on healthcare by making it easier to use insurance money to be a medical tourist.  Heck we could drastically lower Medicare and Medicaid spending just by requiring everyone who is medically able to travel to receive care do so - even assuming airfare + lodging are still paid by the .gov.  Medical outcomes in the best hospitals in places like India are similar to the US. 

To continue with that, part of the reason we attract the best and the brightest to healthcare is that it is one of the highest paying fields to work in.  Not only will you screw over all the current providers if you cut their pay, most of the top students won't enter the field if there's not much money to be made doing it.  Additionally, medical schools wouldn't be able to charge mid 6 figures to graduate and you'd need to figure out what to do with all that debt out there - nearly all US trained doctors are entering the field with a few hundred thousand in loans.  Finally, there's a reason why top US medical schools attract the best students across the world - they are not only providing the best instruction, but they are preparing the students for a lifetime of high wages as a top quality medical practitioner.

Beyond provider compensation, we also demand the latest and greatest technology which comes with a stiff early adopter penalty.  Medical technology, like MRI's, are common in the US well before they are used in even first world countries.  The US is the 'relief valve' in this sense, drug and device companies heavily rely on the US to 'subsidize' worldwide development in medicine - there are many breakthroughs that would never have happened were it not for the US being willing to pay top dollar for them.

So yes, needless to say 'quicker elective surgeries' isn't the only reason people don't want single payer."dhj4a8q,1494732854,jphsnake,dhj5bh4,http://www.gallup.com/poll/187922/clinton-admired-woman-record-20th-time.aspxdgyzl12,1493608643,CavalierTunes,dgz0d7i,"- I already mentioned reinstating Glass-Steagall. It's important, I believe, to separate commercial and investment banking.

- We need to institute something along the lines of the Robin Hood tax: speculation and trading shouldn't control our economy the way it does, and Wall Street is too powerful.

- I'd actually enforce monopoly laws.

- I'd disallow corporations from making political contributions.

- I'd tax corporate profits that aren't reinvested at a *much* higher rate. If a company is making that much money, they should either reinvest it to grow the company more, or use it to pay their employees.

- I'd get rid of off-shore tax havens, and criminally punish those who illegally take advantage of them.

- And I'd institute a tax on corporations with a rate based on the income disparity between their highest paid employee and their average worker (so, corporations that pay their CEO hundreds of millions of dollars, but pay their average worker minimum wage would pay a lot; whereas, corporations that pay their CEOs closer to a million, and their average workers above minimum wage would be paying less; and corporations that are small and everyone makes in the same range wouldn't pay anything under this tax).

It was no mistake to fire him. It's clear the decision was thought out for quite some time. Where was he shown to be ""untrustworthy"" or ""vicious"". Seem like typical political filler. To a democrat, yeah probably. To a Republican, no probably not. Who are you, or me, to say who's right? Where's the middle ground?

The fact is that all the Republicans up for re-election are in deep red states other than Heller in Nevada. Nevada is a blue state and Heller is a highly vulnerable senator; yet, he is still far less vulnerable than nearly all of the at-risk Democratic senators. Clinton only won his state by 2 points. The next most vulnerable senator is Flake is Arizona. Trump won Arizona by 5. It's a purplish state so, despite incumbent advantage, he is vulnerable in a wave election. Now, you start getting into knocking off Republican incumbents in deep-red states. Here, Ted Cruz is the next most vulnerable because Trump ""only"" won his state by 9. Don't forget this is a state where every single statewide office is Republican and the previous margins of Republican candidates are closer to 20%. All the other seats are nowhere near vulnerable even if sitting senators retired for whatever reason simply due to how red the states are. We're talking Mississippi, Montana, etc. These states electing a blue senator would truly require an apocalypse in the modern polarized environment. So, we've looked at the Republican side. They are defending 8 seats total with only 2 being reasonably vulnerable.

Now the Democratic side: on the purely math side, Democrats are defending 25 seats. They are defending 3x as many seats which mean their resources and money will be far less concentrated on each individual candidate. But wait, it just gets worse and worse for the Democrats. The Democrats are defending **five** seats where Trump won by over 20%. These are deep red seats where Democrats, in a highly polarized environment, have to convince stalwart Republicans to vote for them. It doesn't matter if every single Democrat turned out and the Republicans had mediocre turnout. Democrats need a massive number of people who voted for Trump to turn around and vote for their Senate candidates. The problem is these kinds of voters are becoming increasingly rare as politics becomes more like sport where you ""root"" for your side.  Bear in mind, these are only the worst of the seats. Democrats still have 15 other seats which are in varying levels of competitive. Of those 15, another 5 are in states where Trump won. These seats, due to incumbent advantage, are relatively safe. That being said, they will still be competitive with the Democrats being forced to take them seriously and even face dangers of losing should they get complacent. This means they will still suck up resources and money that are gong to absolutely be needed in these deep red states where Democrats are an endangered species. As for 2020, the map is roughly flipped. Republicans are defending 22 seats and Democrats 11. That being said, these seats are not nearly as vulnerable as Democrats are in 2018. These are not Republican senators running in deep blue states such as California or Oregan. For the most part, they are running in purplish, light blue, or red states. Incumbent advantage will make them hard to knock off though likely a couple of gains will be made unless a wave election occurs for one side or the other. In 2022, things get interesting. This will be a redo of the 2016 map where Democrats had a serious chance at large gains. In 2016, Democrats lost several realistically winnable states such as Pennsylvania where the Republican only lost by 1%, Florida which is a perennial swing state, Ohio another perennial swing state, and Wisconsin. Not to mention that the Arizona seat will truly be a fight with McCain retiring.

Overall, a great election in 2016 for Democrats would be a net loss of one seat or even 0 seats due to just how piss poor the seats up for election are on both the offense and defense. Winning in Nevada and losing a deep red senator in a state such as Indiana or Montana is what would happen in that kind of scenario. Looking purely at the map 1 and a half years out, which of course is not reliable as massive changes can occur before election time, a couple of seats lost is most likely. What you need to look out for at this point is candidate recruitment. Are the Republicans able to find top-tier candidates and provide them with the machinery to make them competitive against senate incumbents? If things start to look bad for the Republicans, many top-tier candidates will refuse to run. Here's an article from WaPo about some early signs of trouble in that area. Once again though, things change. If there are still problems about a year out from the races, that's a real problem. Watch out for announcements about running for seats in the summer and early fall. So far, things have been poor for the Republicans. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/13/do-senate-republicans-have-a-trump-recruiting-problem/

Bear in mind that at this point, polls and surveys are useless in these senate races. Surveys and polls are really only useful for looking at the House as the races are lower profile and thus more connected to the national mood. The House is no doubt in play in 2018 due to historical headwinds and Trump's unfavorables. These are less predictive in Senate races and can be undone by the fact that Democrats are running in such unfavorable states."dhtrgjz,1495344901,JQuilty,dhu5cqh,At the least it will be a great learning experience for how cults of personality work.

Given how much the American public have lost confidence in American wars I hardly think they want to see randomly chosen people sent to kill and be killed in them.

The problem is that no one really expects the draft to be instated so there isn't a lot of political energy spent on reforming it, which I'm guessing would require a constitutional amendment, a huge ordeal that's hard to make happen even with a big super majority behind it.

Not necessarily. Just because Clinton was more popular amongst voting Democrats does not mean she'd be more popular with the voting public at large. As numerous people on this thread have said: they have family who voted Trump, but would've voted Sanders had he run. I don't know if there are as many people who voted Clinton but who would've voted Trump had Sanders run.

&gt;First - Trump would have destroyed Bernie in the debates; Clinton came close even when treating Sanders with kid gloves so as not to piss of his supporters.

It's possible. Sanders isn't the worlds most eloquent speaker. But what he does say really resonates.

&gt;Second - If there are people who went Obama --&gt; Trump; because they hated Clinton, there is likely just as many that hate big government and communism enough to view trump as the lesser of 2 evils.

Many people didn't like Clinton because of trade issues. Conservatives because ""NAFTA took our jobs!""  Liberals because ""the TPP is just a big giveaway to corporations!""  Sanders' focus on label was a huge appeal for him. I doubt there are many Trump-voters who think Sanders would advocate too much for big government, but who think Clinton would make government just the right size.

&gt;Third - Trump vs Sanders is like asking which shit-sandwch tastes better.  Sanders is not a heck of a lot better than trump on governing, building compromise and having detailed policy plans (remember his ~~plan~~ stump speech to break up the big banks_

That's largely speculation: we haven't seen Sanders in a position to govern. For many people (e.g., those that voted third party), thought Clinton vs. Trump was like asking which $#-sandwich tastes better. They thought they were both too involved with big business. And Sanders tended to appeal more to Independent voters than Clinton.

Like it or not, the Millennial generation is more socialist than the Baby Boomers. Our political makeup as a country is changing.

However, let's assume that the investigation is concluded before the midterm. What's optimal then? I'd say it would optimal to not having voted yet. Remember, Trumps approval among Republicans is still in the high 80s. Voting to impeach him is probably suicide right now. Voting to not impeach him alienates independents. So I don't think the House would benefit from voting to impeach Trump now. Maybe right now, to give tempers some time to cool down, but I don't think going to, due to Trumps high approval "69jtaz,1494051694,sharkbait76,dh75f93,"Hello, /u/kulltsb. Thanks for contributing!
